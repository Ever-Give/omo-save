Hi everyone,

I was going to post my next chapter (very delayed, as always!), but having seen all the comments I think maybe I shouldn't post anymore of the story. The story is set in the environment of pretty strict parents, because that's what I know (and my stories are all based on stuff that I've seen/experienced), but I don't want to upset anyone by it seeming abusive.

If anybody wants to trade more stories (true ones, or fiction), just PM me as I'm always happy to share stories on IM.

Hi everyone, thanks for all the messages. Sorry to disappoint, but I'm not planning to continue the story on here.

It's not just the response to this chapter (so please don't blame one person), people have been unhappy or upset about its themes a couple of times now.

Like I said, happy to IM if people want to share fiction or hear about real life incidents that inspired this story, but I'm not intending to post any more chapters on here.

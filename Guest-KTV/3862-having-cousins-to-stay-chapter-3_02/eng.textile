Hi everyone,

Thanks so much for all the comments. I do still want to continue this story, and hopefully keep making in better!

I've been away for a while, but I've also been struggling to decide where to take it in Chapter 4...any more suggestions would be great!

Hi everyone, sorry I neglected this story for such a long time.

Chapter 4 is now partly written, and I'll post it very soon. It's not too late for any storyline requests though...!

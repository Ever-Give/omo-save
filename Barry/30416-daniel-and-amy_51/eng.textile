I am definitely going to continue this. I am constantly thinking about the next chapter. Been busy lately with a private role play story, and the Diaper Verse tale which hasn’t proved to be very popular unfortunately.

Also in the real world, I’ve been unwell for a week or so, and recently lost my job. My best friend is losing his battle with cancer, and I’ve been spending a lot of time with him while I still can.

All of these factors combined haven’t put me in a great place to write ATM.

In my head, I have the next few chapters written, but I want to be prepared to really hit the ground running with it and continue properly, not just post a random chapter every few months.

So don’t worry. These kids are always in the background of my thoughts, and I’m keen to continue, I just need to be in the right headspace first.

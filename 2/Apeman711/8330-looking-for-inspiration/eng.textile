I don't know how many of you have read my story "The Kidnapper". Honestly, I don't know if I'll continue. I have a chapter or so planned at the moment, but I'm not really interested in writing it anymore...

So! I'm still interested in writing stories for this site. Right now, I don't have any topics in mind. That's where you come in. Just recommend me some ideas to write about. I don't care if it's fanfiction or fiction. However, if you recommend a fanfiction, I won't write about it unless I know the topic. :Ð¿

When I think about it, not so much. The fanfics I would like to write would range from Star Wars to Mario. I'm not one to say what I'm good at, rather I get a few ideas and decide from there.

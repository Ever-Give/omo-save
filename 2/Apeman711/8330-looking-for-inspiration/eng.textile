Not sure how many of you have read my story "The Kidnapper". I honestly don't know if I'll continue it. At this point, I have a chapter or so planned out, but I really am not interested in writing it anymore...

So! I am still interested in writing stories for this site. Right now, I have no topics that I have in mind. That's where you come in. Just recommend me some ideas to write about. I don't care if they're fanfictions or fictions. However, if you do recommend a fanfiction, I will not write about it unless I am knowledgeable in the topic. :p

When I think about it, not much. Fanfics that I'd be willing to write on would vary from Starwars to Mario. I'm not one to say what I'm good at, rather I get a few ideas and decide out of those.

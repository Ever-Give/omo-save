Nashville story?

Has anybody on here been watching the TV show Nashville?

If so, would anyone enjoy an Omo Fiction about Rayna's two daughters? It seems to me that the situation of often being out on tour with their mom is one that could be quite testing for the bladders of two youngish girls (given that everybody else in that environment is an adult).

Plus maybe one (or both) girl has a bedwetting recurrence from their parents getting divorced, there's the whole older/younger sister dynamic, and the older girl just starting to get of the age to be interested in boys etc.

Any interest?

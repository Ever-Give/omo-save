What it says on the label! I can't link a fic of mine for a sample, but I do have an AO3 under the same name. The fic I had in mind to maybe evetually post(or at least link to) is called Losing Control, an Ace Attorney/Homestuck crossover.

I'll do any fandom you like, it just might take me a little longer for fics with characters/ fandoms I'm unfamiliar with (i like keeping the characters somewhat in character)so ask away!

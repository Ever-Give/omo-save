Ths seemed like a fun idea when I thought of it,so why not? :)

So here's how it goes-I post a paragraph,someone adds to the story in the comments. This goes on untill someone comes up with an ending.

The story ends with Mario ending up peeing on the side of the building. I might make an alternate ending where Mario wets himself if this goes as planned.

Ready? Go.

The desert area was scorching hot, almost hot enough to fry an egg. Mario looked around the area-nothing but sand and a large temple-like building that went straight up. He had drank a couple bottles of water to keep himself hydrated earlier,and already he was sweating. Stepping forward,he felt a small twinge in his bladder but ignored it.

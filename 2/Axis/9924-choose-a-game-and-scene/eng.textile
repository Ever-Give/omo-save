I want to get back into writing fanfiction for you guys, but I don't know what you like! Please give me a scene from a video game that you would like me to omorashize (or make one up). Please include at least one male and one female character. Thanks! If you want see my favorite and therefore more likely to be chosen games, please visit my profile page. Feel free to friend and/or message me. I'm bored after blowing up the Death Egg MK II.

Thanks again,

Sonic the Hedgehog

{{:

Based on your profile, I'd say Sonic is your favorite.

Can I request:

Female:

Amy Rose

Rouge the Bat

Male:

Tails or Charmy Bee

Scene. Say, Amy and the male character stumble upon Rouge trying to steal a jewel, the security system traps them, desperation ensues.

I like it! I'm going to start right away! (that doesn't mean stop giving me ideas everyone. Please keep posting!)

Sonethin' tells me you just beat Sonic 4: Episode 2. :D

Sure did:) Now I'm off to brush up on my automobile racing. It's fun but I like Extreme Gear the best. You get more control. Now that I think about it, I should really thank Tails more for building me all of these things.

Thank you Krystal I will look that up.

Tails, it isn't going too well, I haven't found any since you gave me yours. Love your idea I'll see what I can do.

I just thought I'd leave a stub here on the forums to acknowledge the fact that I've been continuing my Friends fanfic lately, though the chapter entries have been getting fewer and fewer due to a very busy career change/new marriage/new summer destination for me. I just posted chapter 11 to the Fiction tab, so for those of you who don't regularly check in and are interested… it's there.

I had more fun writing this fanfic novella than I ever did writing fetish fanfic… it's a culmination of many of my twisted ideas about the franchise… and my evil (heh) colleague Vexer added some of his own. into the mix to keep the creative juices flowing... so check it out. :)

I think my next project, once this one is finished, won't be fanfic, although it may have some sci-fi elements, I want to practice creating characters rather than just using existing ones. :) My wife, after reading some of the fetishistic works of other authors I had on my Kindle, said she wanted to see me try writing my own because, and I quote, "You write better than these guys, and you can use better language that doesn't seem so harsh!" So... the next thing I do will probably be my own characters and will be considerably softer in tone. This story covers a range of tones (though I try to remain respectful) that are dictated by the characters I'm working with... my own characters can develop however I want.

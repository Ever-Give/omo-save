I'm not sure if this goes in this section, if not could you please transfer it.

I want to write more fanfiction stories but all of my ideas are closely related.

I love writing and would like to write more, so if people want to give me some ideas I will write the stories for them. All I need are

1. basic idea

2. characters/ names

3. how long and detailed

I am not really familiar with anime characters so i cant really write about them unless I have some time to research ;)

I've already made a request on this forum, so simply copying it over to this thread. Hope this is enough information, do say if you're interested and want more detail.

Sorry but this story is becoming difficult to write.

No matter how I try, it turns our awkward and not convincing.

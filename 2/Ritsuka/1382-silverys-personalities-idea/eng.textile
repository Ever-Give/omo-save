Not sure if this is in the right place >.> but...

I've been doing some work [with my camera] with Dance Covers. Since most of them have multiple parts, I'm greenscreening them together, so I made up five different characters all played by me, each represents different parts of me and has three usable names [A color, an adjective and a human name that I chose at random]. There are two boys and three girls [Listed below].

White/Innocent Silvery [Roi]

Black/Tsundere Silvery [Aimee]

Grey/Neutral Silvery [Gina]

Red/Gangster Silvery [MALE] [shawn]

Neon/Scene Silvery [MALE] [Can also be called 'gender confused Silvery'] [Jordan]

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in me writing an omorashi fiction using them...? I'd also be open to taking requests with fictions involving them. So, any thoughts? [[And yes, this means I will write female desperation if requested...]]

### Silvery >.>

[[PS. I'm doing this to try to pull myself from a writers' block for Curse of an Angry 14 Y/O, I promise, I will update that as soon as possible.]]

How about a story with all of them as a dance group, and the tsundere Aimee finds herself in a desperate situation, ending in a wetting? Getting support from her friends in the end, of course.

Ooo~ I like that~ ^^ I'll try to write that...

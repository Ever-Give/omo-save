Hi, guys, sorry I've been starting so many topics lately...

Anyway, I was browsing the archives of the Thomas Water Resource page, and I came to Month 4 of the competition page, where the story was to write a tale about what would happen if an alien came and simultaneously filled the bladders of everyone in the world.

The stories I'm looking for couldn't be accessed from the site, so here's the ones I couldn't get;

- "Tales from 'The Day The Earth Couldn't Sit Still'" by Bob

- "The Wild Blue(?) Yonder" by Bob

- "Monsters" by Sam

- "The Dream Team Save the World" by Michelle

Any leads would be appreciated.

We really do, don't we?

I'd enter if we had another contest...

It's fine with me... I look forward to it. :)

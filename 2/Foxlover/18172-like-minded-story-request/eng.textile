Obviously, many of you have read the gripping tale entitled "The Day the Earth Couldn't Sit Still", where an alien mysteriously shows up the Earth with one task; to flood every human's bladder with urine.

Now, this a great story, and I must ask... Are there any others like it? Stories where some outside mystical forces causes large amounts of people to become desperate at the same time? If so, I'd really like to know about them.

Thanks in advance,

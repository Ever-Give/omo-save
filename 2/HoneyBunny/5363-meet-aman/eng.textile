Aman is not your typical Egyptian girl -- no she is far from it. She lives during the time when the only transportation were horses, no electricity was known about, and paper was made out of papyrus; you guessed it. Aman lives in ancient Egypt. She has powers that of no one could ever have, yet she is only human. Her brother is Atem (I decided to make them twins, since Atem off of YuGiOh is a powerful pharaoh and I just LOVE ancient Egypt and YuGiOh), the pharaoh. They have a close bond, but still quarrel a lot.

Many people would never think that Aman has powers. She has the ability to heal, to fly, to freeze people so they couldn't move, and more. Even though she is powerful in this, she still had a major weakness -- her bladder. At age sixteen she is still wetting the bed and having accidents. Aman still is sometimes able to hide this, although Atem sometimes finds out. He'd never tease her, but would instead comfort her like the big brother he was.

Aman knew of her problem, yet she still drinks a lot of fluids. This is because she was always active, and the sun could kill her if she didn't keep her body hydrated. Now this leads to a funny story that happened once...

Stay tuned for a story about my character!

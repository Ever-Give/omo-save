I had a few ideas for omorashi stories. While I will probably do them all eventually, I wanted to take a poll to see which one I should write first. Here they are.

1. Bayonetta's Naughty Pee

A Bayonetta fanfiction. The titular character has to pee and, being a tease, decides to pee in public...

2. A Desperate Battle

A Super Smash Bros fanfiction. Lucina is partnered with Palutena for a 2v2 fight, but she has a more pressing concern... Also contains yuri between the two.

3. Peeing in Disguise

This one's not a fanfiction, but rather it uses my own original characters. A girl decides to dress up like a boy and pee standing up. She tries to get into the boys' restroom only to find that it is out of order...

4. Yellow Ink

A Splatoon fanfiction. Agent 3 discovers she should have asked for a pee break before the mission...

All right, the results are in! I will do #4 first! Then #2, then #3. Stay tuned and thanks to all who voted.

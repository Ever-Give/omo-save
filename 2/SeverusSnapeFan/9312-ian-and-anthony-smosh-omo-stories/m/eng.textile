I was looking for some good male omo stories that I hadn't read and by luck I came across this girl's livejournal and she has a ton of them. They go back to about May of this year and she still updates it regulary. Some varies but mostly all of her stories has to do with pee, she puts warnings above the stories so you can check it out. My favorite one is called Obstacles and its 3 parts and has a desperate Ian. I enjoyed it thoroughly.

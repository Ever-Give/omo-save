A parody of Queen's Classroom:

Kazumi is now starting JHS

She thought her sixth grade teacher was the devil

But will the Hell ever end?

Not really an original story, but just continued the Hell through JHS to see if I can convey the feelings that were presented in the drama series for her sixth grade year. May not be top quality. Doesn't include a wetting yet, but it will soon if the story takes off. :)

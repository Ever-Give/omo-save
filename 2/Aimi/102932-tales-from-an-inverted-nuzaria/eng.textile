Heya again! It's been, how long, since I last uploaded on this site? Like two years or something?

Well, guess who's back!

That's right! It's me!

I'm here to present more characters and stories from my world, except, I'm here to do it right. I'm here to do a better job this time.

So, um yea... It's been a while, so I'll figure out how to format everything again. (I'm pretty sure that doing it in Replies is how it works on this site... Right?)

As for what's going on, um...

All you need to know is;

- Alternate Universe of my main world.

- (I'm gonna make them pee so much more than usual. You best believe.)

- The whole thing will eventually tell a single, full story.

- (Yes, it's gonna be a Non-Linear Narrative, that's kinda my whole deal now.)

I think that's all from me. Just a short status update before I submit something.

I'm gonna get to writing now.

Thank you, thank you!

I don't plan on updating super often, just because I am working on a full story with this world, but just since some people asked so very nicely (And because I checked my email today), I'll be giving a few chapters out.

It does feel a little weird to be back on here though. But, I hope you'll all look forwards to when I actually post something.

I found the profile of someone called Francine-frcxa on Literotica and it contains a lot of stories about pee desperation. I loved the ones I read so far, so I decided to post a link to her profile for anyone else who might be interested:

Interesting.

I recognize a number of the stories from 'Shara and Ger's' site, from the author Francine

but there are also several that look new to me.

I'll be interested to check them out.

I just found that out too. I think I've read almost all dtstories on that site 'though and lots of these are new to me. Therefor, I assume this are more stories by the same author.

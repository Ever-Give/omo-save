I have always had an interest in writing and have recently taken to using writing prompts to write a short story, dialogue, or simply create a character every day. This is my first attempt at something omorashi-related. I have to warn you that as an omorashi fiction I did not do a very good job. The wettings, I am aware, are rushed. My excuse for this is that the story was not planned to incorporate omorashi at all. I had an entirely different plan (which I plan to use for a different story) but for some reason while writing I ended up switching to something else. That said, I decided to post the story anyway and I hope that at least a few of you will enjoy it.

Thank you! I am glad you enjoyed it. :)

About continuing the story, that would be new territory for me but I will try to explore it. Now that this has taken the direction of an omo story I can probably focus more on that if I get to write more chapters.

As for posting it directly here, I tried to do that but for some reason the copy/paste function wasn't working on this site. Any help on that?

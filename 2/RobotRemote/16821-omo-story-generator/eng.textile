Again... Dunno if posting in right area...

Move it somewhere else if it isn't.

This is a WIP. This picture is a rough idea.

But anyway I'll need some names, reasons for wetting, situations and people to wet in front of.

And other ideas.

Names

Jessie

Jessica

Reasons for wetting

Stuck Zipper

Long line

Situations

Sports Game

Extended Class

People to wet in front of

Mom

Girlfriend.

If this get's done, I might do an Omo Fanfic Genarator (Based off of TV Shows) or a Pokémon fanfic generator (Oh god... doing nearly 700 names,) using the same engine.

This will be done on Game Maker 8.

{{:

So I just fill these out and send them to you?

}}

Sure!

{{:

Make sure the name "Bernard" is available. It's the best female name.

}}

Okay!

{{:

Oh wow, that font is worse than Comic Sans.

Anyway, you might want to post the code if you're posting a program; executables are generally frowned upon here.

}}

I did the font in paint, I'll do it in a different font if you want to,

Here's the GMK file.

You need Game Maker 8 to open it.

{{:

I suggest placing the entire file (along with the GMK) in a RAR or ZIP and then uploading it to Mediafire.

}}

Okay! I can do that!

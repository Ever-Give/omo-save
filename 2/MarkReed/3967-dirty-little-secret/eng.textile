This story isn't mine and I'm leary of reposting the text since I haven't asked permission, but it's my all-time favorite of this genre. Hopefully that will change as I read ll the awesome stuff you guys have here, but this is my contribution. :)

I also really like the femdom subtext. Maybe one day someone will right a 'sequel' that expands into a series of adventures.

Actually I meant to write 'leery,' which is another word for wary. Unfortunately, the spell checker missed it since 'leary' also seems to be a word.

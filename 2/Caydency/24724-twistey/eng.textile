So, I don't know if anybody has discovered this yet.. but there is an amazing omorashi author on DeviantArt. When I say "author", I don't mean a professional author.. but the point gets across. If you haven't checked out their work, click the link below to view their gallery. They don't have a lot of entries, but the amount of content in each entry definitely makes up for it. My personal favorite is Game Over. Tell me your favorite.~

You're welcome guys. I too, am sad that she hasn't written in a long time, but that's why I love her writing -- she makes up for the lack of amount of entries for the amount of story in each one. My god, her detail is amazing. <3

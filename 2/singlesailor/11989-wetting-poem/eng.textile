Walking home fist clenched tight

I must be quite the sight

Wishing my pants weren't so tight

Walking as fast as can be

It's obvious I need to pee

Hoping no one can see!

It started with little itch

Then my bladder began to twitch

From one foot to the other I continuously

Switch.

All around I glance

For a spot to pee, but no chance

I don't want to wet my pants!

It's really starting to hurt

And then i feel a little spurt

I stop it, but now there's a wet

Spot on my skirt

The wetness I can feel

Weakening my bladder further still

But I'd be lying if I didn't acknowledge

The slight thrill

My bladder spasms and tweaks

I let out a little shriek

As I slowly to leak!

The wet spot continues to grow

I can't control the flow

From within there comes a glow

The glow continues to rise

As pee streams down the my thighs

'ah sweet relief' I sigh

I should have hung my head in shame

But there is no one but me to blame

Besides I think I may have just came

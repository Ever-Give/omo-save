Note: This probably belongs in the ask for advice section, but that place seems to deal with some really 'heavy' issues and I would feel bad putting something trivial among such serious issues. If it must be moved, then I understand.

About a year ago, I tried writing an omorashi story based on a story I wrote in school. I intended to write more but a few family issues and a hefty work schedule left me unable to. I became quite busy in the following months and soon enough I found myself unable to write at all. Now, a year and a little later, I decided to give writing a second try, but every time I write something, I feel so overly critical of it that I eventually convince myself that it's an inferior work and scrap it. So...any advice?

I actually know what to write about, the problem I have is with things like structure/pacing/etc. If I feel a sentence is out of place or that two sentences just don't quite click, I don't just delete the sentence and think I can re-write it, I scrap the entire thing and try again.

I'll give it a try. Appreciate it. =)

I just want to thank everybody for the advice, it all goes up in the ol' brain bank for future reference.

Anthony sighed, pacing back and forth in the waiting room. It had been 5 hours since he got the call as Ian's emergency back up, stating that Ian was hit by a stupid drunk. He just wanted to see Ian! His best friend!

Or more, as they had had an ackward conversation before Ian left to pick up a suit for his sister's wedding.

"Anthony PadIlla?" Anthony heard his name, and cam sprinting over to the nurse.

"Is he ok? How bad is he hurt?"

The nurse just sighed and led him to Ian's room. "We had to fix his jaw tissue and skin, so his facial hair is gone, and he will seem very skinny due to stomach injuries, and having to cut of what he had of little fat."

Anthony nodded, and was about to step in the room, when the nurse stopped him.

"Mentaly, his head was hit the memory section of his brain-"

"So he has amnisia?" Anthony asked, nervous.

"Yes, but a certain type. It caused him to forget about most of his life. The reason you were not here sooner is we had our hands on physiologist determine his age. He is about, two, mentally."

Anthony shook his head in disbelief. He knew his friend would do the same for him if he was in this situation.

Hello everyone. I'm usually in the roleplaying area, but have decided to start taking commissions since on my own I right at an author's standpoint.

It's $5 per page I have typed. Paying all at once will move you up the list if I have one.

I can do any anime, manga, cartoon, and movies even if I have to do a little research first. Some that I know really well are DBZ, Black Jack, anything Marvel or Transformers.

Completion dates may vary for the number of pages wanted, I will be typing everything when I get the chance or have nothing else to do.

You can pm if you have any questions about anything.

It's not really that bad considering most are only like a page at most.

With me it would be about 6000-15000 words.

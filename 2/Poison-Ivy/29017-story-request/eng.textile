I recently had the pleasure of watching a movie about a shy girl called Ella who lives with a cruel family. Cursed with the gift of obedience, she must do anything she is told, but has sworn to never tell a soul about her curse.

Can someone please write a story about her being ordered not to pee or to show any sign of desperation, as well as not being allowed to tell anyone about her orders. I would write it myself but I can't write to save my life!

I recently read a fiction a story where a teacher was teaching about the urinary tract in a unique way. She was holding her pee and giving the class clues on how to answer the question of how much pee she was holding but they purposely got the answer wrong till she wet herself. It then goes into a few mini accidents of students in the class that wet themselves among other things from watching her. I can't remeber if I saw it on Shara and Ger's female desperation or here or somewhere else but I really want to read it again. I've looked everywhere but can't find it so please tell me if you know whereto find it. Thank you in advance for anyone who finds it.

It might not work because of warning that pops up when you enter site but if that is the case then enter the sight, click on stories that will be on a list on the top right of screen and then go to the author fox and story name show and tell.

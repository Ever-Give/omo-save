Greetings all

I'm a bit of a writer, and Im starting to write a story of my own. It's not an omorashi one (though it could have a bit in it), so there's a good chance that you might never read it here. But I was thinking of doing a small omorashi story in the future, say, to contribute my thoughts of the fetish to everyone.

Then one day I was reading a few stories from Antifairy, and I was like... =0 wow! The scenes and events were discribed in such a beautiful way! And the omorashi part was cute, yet not in an explicit way.

Full kudos to you, antifairy!

Now I'm a bit jealous that somebody can write so well. I might PM Antifairy later to ask for some tips. In the meantime, does anyone else have some advice for a good omorashi story?

... I'm considering writing an Omorashi fiction story... but I'm not sure what I should include in it. At first, I was just going to do a simple first-time wetting. I could do that.

I did say in my intro that I do love to write, but I wasn't specific with genres and stuff. I'm more a fiction person; I usually write about fantasy and dark, supernatural things. I've never written about omorashi; Hopefully, it'll break my usual pattern of dark fantasy.

Aside from that...

Yeah, I'm thinking about writing omorashi.

Let's hope I finish it.

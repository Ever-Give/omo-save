"I let out my pee

So warm at first but turn into cold.

It felt good just letting it out,

Running down my legs and to the ground.

My panties are wet, But I'll leave it as that

One problem is that I am so far from home.

It's 40 degree out in the cold

I am starting to get really cold

The wind is blowing

My butt is freezing

I need a place that has some heat

A man comes along and seen that I need help

He took my hand and let me into his van

He turn on the heat

And I feel so relief .

He then told me to rest in the back of his van.

He came in the back with me and place his arms around me.

He said, I seen you what you did and I like what I seen.

He took off my pants and pulled down my panties

Then slide a bit of magic inside my hole

After he was done, He gave me a ride home.

I thank him for his help and give him my number

He called me later that night and ask me to come right over"

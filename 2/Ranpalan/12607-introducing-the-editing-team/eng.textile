I love good stories. Writing a good story is kind of like making a good chair: you have to flatten out the metaphorical pointy bits that otherwise make metaphorically sitting rather uncomfortable. Seeing as Omorashi.org is a multicultural community and English is not everyone's first language, I propose we get together a team of people willing to edit stories before they get posted.

Good at spotting suptle mistakes in English spelling and grammar, or better yet, you are a connoisseur of writing style and would love to help perform the finishing touching to ensure no stories ever shall ever contain a sentence like this one? Post below or PM me and I'll add you to the list.

Writing a story and want a few more eyes on it? Post below or PM one of the members on the list with the story and we'll fix it right up for you!

List:

@Ranpalan

@Gylfi

@MasterBowler

@frostyjr2

@Maria-Sanza

@Weaver

@OmoCommando

In delight of looking forward to seeing to you,

Ranpa

{{:

I'm probably just misunderstanding this but... all my stories from here on out need approval before they get publicly posted?

This is all entirely optional.

Updated list. Guides to link to are welcome; I'll add them as a separate list if anyone links some.

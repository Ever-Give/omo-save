As surprising as it may be, I suspect some people may not want to have their stories thoroughly dissected and the bad bits brought up. Just a hunch.

I think having a way for people to contact the whole editing at once, in private, would help. I've had some requests as well, but I'm guessing they're spread out.

I'd gladly add you to the list, but I don't currently have editing rights on the first post. Putting it in your signature like antifairy does might be a better place.

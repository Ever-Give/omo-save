The Dorothy J. Etherington School for Girls by Eratosthenes is one of my all time favorite stories. I don't remember when it was first posted, since it was a bit before my time, but I believe it was originally posted on WetSet in 2002. It has been reposted a couple times since then, but only the first nine out of ten parts! The story as I have read it ends with a massive cliffhanger, and I would love to find out if anyone has the last instalment.

Here's parts 1-3: http://www.wetset.ne...ages/149449.htm

Here's parts 4-6: http://www.wetset.ne...ages/149450.htm

Here's parts 7-9: http://www.wetset.ne...ages/149451.htm

Be warned that there is a little messing in this story, but the vast majority is pee. It was originally posted on the pee board on WetSet, not the poo board.

I agree that it isn't the best story technically, and it isn't a desperation story by any means. The main thing I enjoy is that it has a larger scale plot and character arc that engages me as a story, not just as erotica.

Here's a story I wrote some time ago, about mother and doughter on a train set in a time before corridors.

It's a 'pdf' file which I'm attaching to this message.

I hope you enjoy it!

That was you? I read this on Thomas's Water Resource site AGES ago!

A fan from long ago? Well I did post it ages ago on Thomas' Water Resources site but I didn't expect it to be remembered from back then, still, a good story can stand being told more than once; don't you agree?

What a great doing! If there are some more of these kind, i'd love them beeing posted

I have a few stories which I hope to make available when I get time to find them, dust them off and squirt down the wire to the web.

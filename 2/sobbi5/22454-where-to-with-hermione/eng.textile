I have just posted the third story about Hermione which started with "Flying at "P' Level", then "Hermione experiments", then "What Hermione did next".

From the last two stories there are two possible future stories, plus one other option as noted below.

Question do you want me to write more - if so what story first_

1) The 3W's the Wonderfully Wet Witches Club - Hermione's first meeting

2) Finding out why Ron stole the pair of knickers

3) Hermione back home during the hols discovers her Mother's wet side

The first will obviously involve some lesbian action, the second leads to male and female watersport's and sex, the third to some joint exploring of wet pleasures etc.

Please respond and let me know if you want more!

Thanks for the votes and feedback.

Part 1 of what Hermione did in the holidays has been written

Part 2 will include the visit to the corsetieres, catching up with mum's university fried "aunty" Mavis

Hope you enjoy

Fixed! This is the same post as before.

A note on proficiencies:

{{: 

Now that you have gained a weapon, a weapon proficiency will show up in statistics. That just shows how good you are with the weapon. Fights and training will increase proficiency.

}}

{{: 

I would have chosen knives too. In case you are interested, these knives are messers. Here's a link to the Wikipedia article about them (not super informative, best I could find) http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messer_(weapon)

}}

You pick up the set of knives. The two of them are identical, each with one sharpened edge that curves away from the flat edge, then returns to meet it in a sharp point. They look deadly, and you suddenly feel a bit safer as you strap them to your jeans.

"Ah! Phobos and Deimos. Named after the companions of Sabazras, of course. God of war. Excellent choice."

{{: 

You have become a Knifewoman. Proficiency: 0/10

}}

{{: 

You have equipped yourself with Phobos and Deimos.

}}

"Where would you go?" you ask.

"I'd prefer the Great Road, of course, but if Chaos is indeed rising, we'll need to be quick. I say we go through the Herlasvaald."

You look at him. "Look, I'm just a girl. I haven't even started college yet! What can I do against Chaos?"

Jowan shrugged. "I don't know. But the gods must. You can save us, Rose. The gods are never wrong."

He strides out the door, and you follow. The two of you walk back out into the bright sunlight, where Pike is standing, with three saddled horses.

"Pike! Are you ready to travel?"

He nods. "Yes, sire." You notice he has a knife like yours at his hip, and a long sword is strapped amongst his bags. It appears you are traveling together.

{{: 

You have Allied with Pike of Marrowglen

}}

Jowan hands you a small purse. "Here's all of our money. Since you're the leader, you may handle it."

You look at him, taken aback. "Why am I the leader?"

"You have been brought here from another world, madam. The gods have chosen you. You are fit to be leader." Pike replies.

You shake your head, looking into the bag. All of the money is coinage of various metals. Sighing, you toss the money into your bag.

{{: 

Added to your inventory: Five silver aspri, fifteen bronze skellings, thirty-six tin skellings. (all of these are coins) Warning: inventory is now full.

}}

Jowan gestures towards one of the horses. "Sunflank over there is yours."

You walk over to her, smiling at the sight of the light-colored horse. She's a beautiful thing, who whinnies when she sees you. Already a few packs lie on her back; you tuck your bag in and vault up onto her.

Jowan, already on his horse, canters ahead down the road you came on, and you follow. It occurs to you as you head out that your bladder is even fuller than before, and is starting to get uncomfortable. But your companions are riding ahead, and you don't want to fall behind.

"You mentioned this guy Vajrindra," you ask. "Who is he?"

"The god of thunder and storms. Patron god of Vajrindrath." replies Jowan

"Which is?" you prompt.

Jowan sighed. "I guess I'll just tell you the whole story. A long time ago, before nations were formed, there was a woman named Cassia who was so beautiful, so kind, that she attracted the attention of two gods. Amunros, god of the sun, and Vajrindra. Vajrindra promised her wealth, power, the world. Amunros only promised her eternal love."

"She chose Amunros, right?" you say.

"Yes. They lived together happily, and they had a son. Jurian the Unifier. He founded the city of Amunroth, where we are venturing now, then rode forth and unified all of the nation of Amunroth. Where we are now."

"But Vajrindra felt that his pride was wounded, and so he descended to a nearby city, to find a wife as lovely as Cassia. He did, so they say, in a woman named Lucia. Together they had a son, Rakash, later known as the Conqueror, who founded the nation of Vajrindrath. It borders us to the East, over the Aurgel Mountains."

Pike suddenly speaks up. "Our two nations have warred for as long as our creations. The last war ended just ten years ago. If Chaos is indeed rising, a Vajrindran invasion may be tantamount."

You nod as a sudden pang hits your bladder. Every time the horse strikes the ground, your bladder makes itself known.

"Pike? How many hours do we have left?" asks Jowan.

"Not many. If we ride hard, we can make it to Vaaldedge by nightfall." says Pike.

"Alright." Jowan nudges his horse faster, and Pike follows. You ride off after them, your bladder protesting with the extra bumping.

You ride along the road until you reach a crossroads, where you take a left. You squirm a little in your seat as you ride along It shouldn't be too much longer to Vaaldedge, right? You can go when you reach there.

Just then, you hear a whizzing sound, followed by a thump. Sunflank rears up and neighs, sending you flying from your horse. You land hard, knocking the wind out of you and a drop of pee from your bladder.

Groaning, you look over to see a black arrow embedded in the dirt. Quickly, you stand up. Five men are crawling from the grass on either side of the road. One holds a crossbow, trained on you; two have swords and shields, and the other two have long polearms. All have the same tattered blue uniforms, except for the crossbowman, dressed in a dark green.

"Vajrindran soldiers!" Pike says.

"And an Aventinan crossbowman. Looking for trouble." says Jowan. "What would you have us do?"

Do you:

A) Fight! (If you choose this one, please detail your battle plan in comments.)

B) Attempt to talk to them

C) Run!

D) Bring out Pike's secret whiskey stash and have a drink before you die

E) Other

Yeah sure you can practice. Update will come when I have more replies. In the meantime, a little doodle.

D, while trying to avoid death, and then drunkenly head towards the cross bow man and swing wildly at him.

A note on character death:

{{: 

All deaths are final, including your own. There will be no "restarting from a checkpoint" or something like that. That being said, there is an afterlife, and resurrection is possible, but very rare. So understand that if you die, the story will change dramatically.

}}

{{: 

Btw Pike's inventory is full (he has all the food and his whiskey). If you need either, ask him

}}

"Let's try and talk to them," you say. "Figure out what they're doing."

Jowan nods. "Soldiers of Vajrindrath! I am Jowan, of Sinana! Surrender now and you will be spared!"

The soldiers suddenly stop, bursting out into laughter.

"Hahaha! Look at him, thinks he's Jowan!" says a swordsman.

Abruptly, a pikeman stops laughing. "No! Look, Albrecht! The scarred face! The beard! It's him!"

"Shit shit shit!" Immediately, all of the soldiers bow down, dropping their weapons. You notice the crossbowman doesn't bow, but merely lowers his weapon.

"Please spare us, Lord Jowan," says the pikeman. "We'll do anything!"

"Alright," says Jowan, dismounting. He walks over to them. "Tell me why four Vajrindran soldiers and an Aventinan are armed and on Amunroth's lands. And how, actually."

The pikeman's face turns stony. "That I will not do. I will not betray my god."

"Which god? Vajrindra?" you ask Pike.

"No. They venerate their king as a living god," he replies. "Makes it bloody hard to get them to stop fighting."

"Very well," says Jowan. "There are... other ways to gain information." He draws his sword.

"No!" you yell, running over to Jowan. "What are you doing!"

"Torturing them. We need to find out why they're here."

"No!" you shout, shocked. "Look at these men! They look miserable! Look, they already surrendered! Let's just give them a little food and let them be!"

Everyone stops for a tense moment; then the lead soldier looks over at you. "Her, I tell."

Jowan sheaths his blade. Leaning over, he whispers, "Don't worry. I wouldn't have tortured them. Sometimes the threat is enough. But it seems that kindness was a more effective weapon today."

"We were sent here as advance scouts," the pikeman says.

"For an invasion?" Pike asks sharply.

"Not necessarily. Vajrindrath is divided. Some of the nobility want peace, and some want war. My lord Abraxas of Mahelin is one who wants war, and he has sent his soldiers out, such as us."

"We was assigned to the Herlasvaald," Albrecht the swordsman chimes in. "Not three days into that damned forest we were attacked by demons. The Daystar's people, I tell you. We lost our captain and half our men."

"It's back to Vajrindrath for us. But I thank you for your kindness," the pikeman says, bowing low. "If you ever need help in Vajrindrath, ask for Duran Anjolaj, that being me."

{{: 

You have Allied with Duran Anjolaj

}}

You nod. Pike hands you some food, you give it to them, and you ride on. The soldiers wander off in the other direction.

You vault back onto Sunflank, an action that causes your bladder to protest violently. Quickly, you shove a hand into your crotch, squeezing the denim of your jeans like your life depends on it. For a moment, you consider going in the bushes, but your pride gets in the way. Stupid pride.

"Let's go!" Jowan says. "We need to get to Vaaledge before the night falls!"

The three of you canter off, you shoving your crotch hard into the leather-tooled saddle to contain the tsunami of urine inside of you. The ride is bumpy, and more than once a chance pothole sends you flying and a painful jet of pee squirts out, dampening your panties. But finally, just as night descends, you see from far away the lights of the town of Vaaledge.

The town seems not so much to have been built but to have grown, a ramshackle cluster of broken-down houses and broken-down people. As you ride through the streets, men and women dressed in dark clothes give you flinty-eyed gazes before moving on. All have swords or knives at their belts.

You are at this point dancing around on the saddle, trying to control both the horse and your pee. After what seems like an eternity, you arrive at a structure that could barely be considered a building. A decrepit sign out front proclaims it to be the Last Chance Inn.

Jowan vaults down and bangs on the door. It swings open to reveal a fat, greasy man holding a lantern in one hand and a meat cleaver in the other.

"Inn's closed. All the rooms sold."

Jowan pushes past him. "We'll bunk in the common room."

Pike follows, a hand on his knife, and the man steps aside. You gingerly step off just as a strong spasm hits your bladder, and you squeeze your crotch with all your might.

"Miss? You coming or going?"

"B-bathroom," you gasp out, and he points around the side. You hobble over to find what he considers a bathroom.

You nudge open the door with your leg, not daring to remove your hands, and gasp in horror. First off, it's a hole in the ground. But even among holes in the ground, it's nasty. Some previous visitor must had the runs, because there is shit everywhere. If this hole was a human, it would be the homeless guy who smells nasty and screams at you to repent when you walk past. Shuddering with horror and your desperation, you close the door.

Do you:

A) Brave the hole

B) Attempt to hold on longer

C) Go in the bushes

D) Other

You shake your head, bouncing up and down in a desperate pee dance. You can't go in conditions like this, no matter how badly you have to go. Slowly, you edge out of the outhouse, letting the door slam.

You contemplate for a second going into the rustling bushes behind the inn. But you don't know who or what could be hiding back there, waiting to take advantage of you.

Your mind whirls, trying to think of a plan. You have no delusions about your ability to hold on for the rest of the night. At this point, you're thinking about how to get away with it.

Hesitantly, you take a step towards the inn. Oh, you have to go so bad! You take another, and feel your bladder shudder. Another jet squirts out, offering no relief.

"Evening," says a voice from over your shoulder, somewhere out there in the darkness. You jump, startled, and the dam breaks. First a small trickle of pee bursts forth with a hissing sound, dampening your panties, then it widens into a stream of golden liquid. Slowly, your pants grow soaked as pee cascades from you, and you can't help but moan a little at the incredible relief you feel.

"A knight, a baron, and a crossdresser walk into an inn. There's a joke that starts like that, but it isn't for mixed company, and I have the feeling you people aren't the joking sort." You snap back to the present, realizing there's someone out there, watching you. You shove your hands into your soaked crotch, attempting to stem the flow of pee to no avail.

"Who are you?" you ask, hesitantly, a luminescent blush growing on your cheeks.

"Faolan's the name. Some call me Faolan the Shadow." A figure steps out of the darkness, wearing a long black cloak. They reach with a black-gloved hand and pull back the black hood, revealing (amusingly) a shock of blonde hair.

The figure looks up at you, and you realize it's a boy. Around the same age as you, and not bad looking, with a nose that would have been described as perfect had it not been broken before and a lazy smile. In the darkness, you can't see his eyes.

As the hissing sound draws to a close, and the flow of pee coming from you begins to wane, he speaks up. "Bodyguard, assasin, thief, pirate, mercenary, impersonator of the clergy, and occasionally a guide. You're heading to the Herlasvaald, are you not?"

You nod, hoping he doesn't notice the shimmering stain on your pants or hear the splashes that the drops of pee make, hitting your golden puddle. "How do you know that?"

"The same way I know one of your traveling companions is Jowan of Bauernhof, and the other is either Pike or Pikeas of Marrowglen. If I was a betting man I'd gamble on Pike. The same way I know that you are dripping wet with a liquid I suspect is neither water nor wine." He flashes a sardonic smile, and you blush harder. "Look. The forest is deadly. Men venture in and don't venture out. People aren't lying when they say there are demons in there." He leans forward. "You'll need a good guide if you want to survive. For three silver aspri, my partner and I will be those guides. My partner is Annalisa Guntrain, daughter of Guntra the Axe, and together we've passed through the Herlasvaald five times."

You stare at him, and he gives a mock salute. "Think it over." With that, he vanishes into the darkness once more.

You stare at the spot where he was just a moment ago, then grudgingly return to the inn. The fat man with the cleaver is standing at the door, and he raises an eyebrow as you walk past in soaked pants. You snarl at him, tears appearing in your eyes, and he backs off.

The taproom is filled with people and noise, laughter, drunken rambling, and song. A woman comes towards you holding flasks of an amber-colored liquid and an idea comes to you; quickly, you bump into her, and the drinks spill onto you. She barks at you a little, but you don't care; no one else will know of your accident. Relieved, you sit down with Pike and Jowan, who are tucking in to a table of food.

"Eat up!" says Jowan, cheerfully. "We'll sleep in the common room, provision in the morning, and then head off!"

* * *

You walk into the doors of the store. It was the only store around, or so the locals said, professing their loyalty to good old Robaj and Bluecove's. You buy breeches and a shirt for a brass skelling apiece, then wander around the store looking for anything else you might need.

Inventory of the Shop:

{{: 

A fishing pole: two brass skellings

A coil of rope: five tin skellings

A vial of water from the Fountain of Amunros (for Defense against Demons): two silver aspri

An old unstrung crossbow with four bolts: three bronze skellings

A grappling hook: four bronze skellings

You may also attempt to trade something in your inventory for these items

}}

"So," someone whispers in your ear. You turn to see Faolan. "Will you hire Annalisa and I? Just three silver aspri, a paltry sum for nobility like you, and we'll get you across the forest with nary a scratch."

Do you:

A) Hire them

B) Attempt to bargain with them

C) Refuse

D) Other

OPTIONAL: Buy something. Last chance until you reach the capital!

@Despfan: There are demons in the forest. One of the few places left that has them. To kill a demon, you need something holy (as in, water from the Fountain of Amunros, one of Vajrindra's stone axes, or any magic weapon) or straight up magic.

@Ranpalan and @alaiteir: You always do need rope, don't you? I'd say it's the most useful thing in the universe, but we all know a towel is :)

There will be maps next update!

I'm not a particular fan for the same reason I'm not a fan of stuff like Long Rifle's work, I think. A bit of embarrassment is good, desirable even, but I keep coming back hoping that things will turn around for the clanswomen, that they'll turn the situation around, topple their oppressors, and take back their rightful freedoms, etc. Maybe it's just not my thing. I guess I prefer happy endings? :/

For me, there's a fine line between what I like and what gets creepy and depressing, so I completely understand where youre coming from. There are a lot of smutty stories I've come across that just make me feel sort of uncomfortable. I was a little worried about how the story would come off, but I think it's probably the reception you would expect from any fetish centric story. Some people will like it and some will hate it.

As for my plans for the story, I'll say that while the women won't have any sort of big victorious turnaround, the ending also won't be anything near as miserable and oppressive as it probably seems like. Thanks for your comment!

Thanks for the comments everybody! I haven't updated this in a while because I got pretty lazy about writing the rest of it and ran into a writer's block. I'm pretty sure I know how I'm going to finish it now, but in the meantime, here's a little sketch I drew for the story!

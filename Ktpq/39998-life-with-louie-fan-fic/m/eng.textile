(Authors notes: this is a fan fic request for Rick Dixon i hope anyone else reading this enjoys this and also this is my first fan fiction so i hope everyone enjoys this)

Anderson was walking through the doors of his sons school auditorium today was the day his son was the main character in the school play of sleeping beauty he was already pretty late for the play as is but you see he already has a more pressing issue in his mind he needed to pee pretty badly at that Anderson had forgotten to go to the bathroom as he was leaving for work can you blame him he was running late and he had so much paper work he had to leave some behind. know Anderson was getting scooting by some people trying to get by so he can sit on the seat his wife saved for him once there he sat and told his wife" wouldn't miss it for the world hun i didn't even have time to use the restroom i gotta go so bad my back my back teeth are pumped " as Anderson said this he had his legs crossed and both hands on his crotch as the play starting they started with the scene where the witch poisoning the apple his focus was mainly on the witches pot witch consisted of boiling water the sight was enough to make me feel the need worsen as he could feel my urine trying to make its was out of my to go he was beginning to feel it go through him system as he held my self and squirmed around for a a few seconds. 

Anderson decided to get up and excused himself for the bathroom " oh man uhh um excuse me ill be right back" was all he could say before his wife grabbed his shoulder and sat him back down" Andy wait its almost intermission now be polite and wait" as Anderson sat down he crossed his arms and said "how polite would it be if we had a little flood in the air". as his son was on stage he could barely hear him he looked at his wife "what did he say my ears are a little clogged up"

As Anderson son was on stage he couldn't really focus as there was a small child next to him sipping on a soda the sound of water just made him even more desperate as anyone could tell just by glancing towards him as he was crossing his legs like a pretzel.

As soon as Anderson he was relived to see the announcement that the intermission was starting " about time that act was nice and concise". as his son and the girl playing the lead were exiting his wife grabbed his jacket and pulled him back down "Andy its starting" she says pulling him down Anderson says "you cant be serious how could he do this to me" he says crossing his legs and squirming around in his seat. as Louie was acting the curtain was opening and revealed a waterfall as he saw this waterfall seat began to form as small bit of urine tried to make its way out remind my body of its urgent need all he could mutter as he sweating was "this is not american". as it was getting harder to hold with the child slurping on his drink and the water fountain all i could mutter in hope of my sun to hurry up so i can go release my pen up urine as he was preparing to kiss the girl " hurry up and kiss her". 

As the kiss was happening i notice the sprinklers going off luckily they were not on for to long as my son did it he kissed her he cheered as well only cause it was over and i finally was able to go not only that but he was able to see his son getting his first kiss from a girl as she spun him around i was honestly quite surprised and proud . my wife turned around grabbed my jacket pulled me down again " so huny how did you get away from work" Anderson replied " so i finished and i left" her respond was " you left work because you knew how it important it was for you to come see you're sons play" Anderson grabs the popcorn from the child next to him "no i came because of the free popcorn" he says this as he is globing the popcorn down he says " mater of fact ill go get some" Anderson then bolt towards the door crossing his legs trying to make it out to the bathroom " I AM GOING TO BURST" is what he says loudly as he tries to waddle to the door.

As Anderson opens the door to the men room leaking a bit on his in crossing his locking his knees together " ugh just my luck" is what Anderson says as he notices the three massive lines for the urinals he decided his best bet was to wait for a urinal to be available he went for the middle one. it did not take to long for three urinals to be vacant and he was able to move up but as hard as he tried the facets running was something Anderson did not wanted to hear he was already at the point of no return hearing all three men in front of him using the urinals and know the running water was two much for Anderson. his bladder finally gave out he could feel his hot urine finally escaping his body Anderson could feel it soaking his underwear and then going towards his pants he could feel it going down his leg it felt so good he could not help give off a sigh of relief and fell on his knees.

Once he came back back to reality and his senses he realized i am on the bathroom floor on my knees my clothing are with pee my pee and i just did this in front of all these people and kids he was not scared or nervous he felt humiliated as he rose his head from the ground slowly he could fell the butterfly's on his stomach flutter violently once his head was up he could go red from how madly he was blushing from everyone staring at how this grown man just wet him self like a small child. all Anderson could do was get up and run out of there as soon as possible with his head towards the car wondering how is he going to explain this to his wife and kids once they seem him. THE END (i hope everyone enjoyed this and i hope Rick Dixon enjoyed this as well this is my first fiction so please go easy on me with the criticism)

(this is an alternative ending were i change the last paragraph and recreate the ending hope you all enjoy) 

Anderson was leaving the auditorium his desperation was reaching a point of urgency and the uncomfortable sensation he was felling on his crotch he was happy to see the bathroom sign as he approached the door. he tried opening the door but it did not bulge just a small crack determine to find out what was blocking and delaying his relief. with both hands on his crotch trying to prevent his pee from exiting Anderson tried to peer his head through the small opening but had no luck all he was successful with was hearing the sounds of everyone in there reliving them selves as well the sound of running water from all the water it was torturer to Anderson he could feel his urine getting closer and trying to inch its way out that was beginning to cause him pain down there he manage to prevent any from escaping he was getting close to the point of no return he was feeling anxious Anderson's face was beginning to redden from all the anxiety he was felling he felt his heartbeat gain momentum in speed as Anderson could feel his hearth on his throat. he began to push on the door tacking it like a football player tackling the opponent he yelled " WHO EVER IS BLOCKING THIS DOOR MOVE IT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY"

Anderson got a respond from a guy he recognized as bob " hey buddy this emergency can wait i am having a conversation here" the next voice he heard was bob's wife Janice and she sounded mad " this why our marriage will not be able to continue to work you always ignore me when i am talking to you" she yelled at bob" you did not have to follow me into the men's room for us to have this conversation it could have waited till we got home and that is another issue everything is now with you it can never wait" bob said to his wife "ohhhh so i am the issue when you get home you can never help around the house its only beer and football with you i am doing this here so that every guy can see how much of an idiot you are "

This arguing back and forth between Janice and Bob went on for quite some time in that time Anderson was doing a potty dance performance for every parent and child walking and stop to see what all the commotion was about in the men's bathroom. eventually security arrive escorting Janice and Bob away Anderson had to move to the side finally he was going to finally get the relief he has been waiting for unknown to Anderson two of his previous coworkers that used to work with Anderson before receiving his promotion were waiting for Anderson to enter they were not in good terms with him once he had left and went to his new office the work load increased to the point where they were struggling to keep up all the while Anderson was just in his office doing nothing when we needed his help now it was payback time.

Anderson was walking in the bathroom when one of his previous coworkers grabbed him by the sides and pulled Anderson closer to him having his hole arm over his shoulders "hey Anderson how are you fancy seeing you here " Anderson replied "yeah today was my sons play Jeff and i came to see it " Jeff replied " yeah that sounded nice my son was also in the play, to bad me and Adam missed it " Jeff said the final part in a very menacing tone Adam was standing by the sink " yeah me and Jeff would have loved to see our kids play but we were not able to you see we had to stay and work because a certain someone decided to leave us with all the dirty work with out any help" Adam said this as he was running the water in the sinks.

The sound of rushing water was torturing Anderson's poor bladder he was at this point dancing in place like a small child desperate to use the bathroom he couldn't take it anymore he needed to use that urinal and he needed it know " guys i know we may not be the best of coworkers anymore and i have not been the best boss out there so is there anyway we can just let bygones be bygones" he says this extending his hand out trying to get a truce out of them Adam and Jeff looked at Anderson smiling at each other nodding in agreement "we want money as well as raises and if we need off we get off no questions ask i am pretty sure you can handle it by you're self boss " they say in unison.

Anderson needing to go took out his wallet giving both a one hundred dollar bill Jeff and Adam gestured for more Anderson gave a frustrated sigh and took out another two one hundred dollar bill " that is all i got " Jeff responded with "that is good boss we expect the form for raises tomorrow with the max amount on them ready to go " said Jeff as him and Adam were about to walk through the door Anderson " will do Jeff and Adam" Anderson said walking toward the urinal finally getting to use it he gave a sigh as he was about to open his fly when the door was open with Adam and Jeff were by the door Anderson's wife came walking in fast grabbing his shirts sleeve "finally found you hun we have to go back to the auditorium one of the parents wants to do a tribute video of a school dance we did here years ago " Anderson could not say anything as he was in to much pain having relief so close taken away from him his bladder was hurting bad as Jeff and Adam watch as Anderson walk by they looked at each other having the same thought " we can still have some fun with our boss ". as Anderson and his wife reached the auditorium Anderson being dragged he looked at his wife " i don't want to dance i got something i need to do and fast".

"Andy don't be like that this dance means a lot to me it was our first dance you asked me out after it was over and you can do you,re thing after the dance is over " Anderson's wife said that Anderson decided to go along with it plus he can finally go the bathroom and not have to worry about being interrupted " fine but make it quick its getting urgent " he says this while pee dancing in place Anderson's wife notices this " hun its good to see you so eager do this " she says this while grabbing by the sides and pulls him to perform the salsa Anderson was to focus on keeping him self from peeing himself as there was cameras recording and taking pictures of this h did not wanted to be the talk of this small town over something like this it was hard on his poor bladder all this moving around it was a miracle he did not wet himself let alone leaked any in his underwear before he knew it the big test was coming the dip he prepared himself mentally as his wife spun him and brought him in 1 2 3 his wife diped him his right leg was above her hip and and he was arched backwards his wife leaning towards him Anderson's bladder was in a lot of pain at this moment it was distracting him as he did not noticed his wife going in for the kiss this caught Anderson by surprise he almost lost his battle with his bladder luckily managed to hold out everyone in the crowd began cheering loudly at there performance Anderson's wife brought them back up for a bow but only she bowed Anderson sprinted out the room for the second time today.

@@As Anderson reached the toilet he could not open it he banged on the door he Asked "anyone in there if there is anyone can you please open up " he could heard no respond as Anderson was knocking and trying to push the door open unbeknownst to him Jeff and Adam were on the door preventing him from entering laughing from inside as they heard Anderson's pleas to enter with no response Anderson does this for awhile in till he seas a teacher he asked the teacher turning around slowly he asks her "miss is there another bathroom at this school " the teacher looks at Anderson shocked that this man was standing in front of her looking like a pretzel "there is a unisex toilet in the other side of the school on hall 204 that is open but there is a men's room on hall 203 before it " as soon as Anderson heard that he began running that way the teacher saw this " no running in the halls the older they are they are still as rebellious as ever ' she says this walking the other direction Jeff and Adam heard were the other two bathrooms were and devising a plan.

Anderson running finally saw the men's room on hall 203 as soon as he walked in opening the door he noticed how long the lines were for three urinals with seven deep each the stall were without any door there is no way he was using those he went for the middle line it did not take long for three urinals to become vacant at the same time the sight of these three men urinating in the front was to much for Anderson he looked away as he noticed there sighs of relief as a warm golden liquid was escaping them it made Anderson fell his need all the more closer to his breaking point as he looked away he instantly regretted his choice as the sight of running water was to much for Anderson his need slip away from his hold he held on with all his strength as he tried to prevent his hold from breaking once he regained composer he released " i cant hold it til its my turn i gotta try the unisex toilet in hall 204" with that he made a run for it little did he know what was waiting for him there.

Once Anderson saw the unisex sign he ran in he saw a person entering the restroom " wait let m,e in first its an emergency" but the person went in little did Anderson realized it was Jeff entering and as he noticed Anderson making his way he smiled as he closed and looked the door Anderson was banging on the door begging who ever was in there to please hurry up but no luck his best bet was to wait. a few seconds lather his old high school girlfriend Suzy she is wearing a red dress that shows off her legs and body she notices Anderson standing there and begins to talk catching up "hey Andy long time no see how have you been " Anderson with his legs locked together and his legs pressed tightly " nothing much just here to see my Louie at the play" Suzy pressing her legs together crossing her them " i heard he was really good " yeah im very proud of him so what have you been up to i m working i cant really say there is just a lot of paper work"

"that is good i am a school teacher hear" Suzy says Anderson replies " i remember you telling me how you wanted to be a teacher back in the day, i hope who ever is in there can hurry up"

"Yeah me to . as Suzy said this Anderson could feel his anxiety kick in not only did he need but Suzy does as well it dos not really bother him hes already married it would still be embarrassing for him as he cant have an accident in front of everyone seeing how he can hear people exiting towards hear seeing how the after party was almost done he could feel his hearth racing it was beginning to get harder to breath he was more focus at this point at making about making it then listening to Suzy.

@@As if a sign from heaven he heard the toilet flush and began grabbing himself through his brown slacks seeing how Suzy was looking away all we saw was someone exiting the bathroom not saying a word as he turned around and walked away towards, the main exit that was in front of us suzy turned around grabbing her crotch asking me if it was ok if she went first i could not reply fast enough as she walked towards the bathroom she opened the door as she stood in fear hand on her mouth as she was gasped Anderson walked over still grabbing his crotch legs bending together the sight was truly horrifying the toilet was clogged and water was rising beginning to flood the ground in matter of seconds the water had rached our feet the sensation of the water soaking my feet sent a shiver up my spine as my damn was about to burst next i heard the sensation of a strong stream hitting water when i looked over suzy was wetting her self you could see her stream exiting her body from under her skirt the sight was to much for Anderson as his damn brook he fell on his knees as the warm sensation of his bladder finally releasing all its pent up pee it felt great the sensation of his underwear getting warmer as it ran down his legs soaking his brown pants making them a darker shade the part of his pants getting warmer that were soaked by the toilet water it felt nice he couldn't felt but give a sigh of relief as the sensation was wonderful. once the bliss was over Anderson looked around suzy was no wear to be seen but to the left was all the parents and students that were involved in the play his hearth sanked as it was obvious as to what hapened a puddle of yellow liquid around Anderson his face went red he was to ashamed to say anything as he walked out the door. once in his truck Anderson sat there in his pee soaked clothes he didn't know what do to once his wife and Louie they began the drive home the only thing that was mentioned was his wife saying " i guess the janitor is going to have one busy morning ' Anderson chucked at his wive's comment he leaned over and gave her a kiss once they were at a red light " lets go to youre favorite place to get food to go so we can celebrate you're first play going great and youre first kiss " Anderson says giving Louie a play full nudge and a wink THE END ( i hope evryone that made it this far enjoyed my extremly extending ending)

Next i heard the sensation of a strong stream hitting water when i looked over suzy was wetting her self you could see her stream exiting her body from under her skirt the sight was to much for Anderson as his damn brook he fell on his knees as the warm sensation of his bladder finally releasing all its pent up pee it felt great the sensation of his underwear getting warmer as it ran down his legs soaking his brown pants making them a darker shade the part of his pants getting warmer that were soaked by the toilet water it felt nice he couldn't felt but give a sigh of relief as the sensation was wonderful.

Once the bliss was over Anderson looked around suzy was no wear to be seen but to the left was all the parents and students that were involved in the play his hearth sanked as it was obvious as to what hapened a puddle of yellow liquid around Anderson his face went red he was to ashamed to say anything as he walked out the door.

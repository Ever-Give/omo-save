Alexxx I you permit me. Can I use Pokespeak in my fanfic story?

}}

Certainly! ^_^

(Alexxx - While I don't think you can edit it here because of how posts work, I could make the change in the Pastebin documents, if you'd prefer. Your fic, your choice to be honest.)

Sure, thank you! I think 2.89ml is more reasonable, right?

Kidding...how about 240ml?

Got it! Considering what Mew said about it and the ratio being about 1.4x for liquid held vs capacity, I'm going to change the amount of liquid Static could hold (in his stomach and bladder) to

341 milliliters, if that's alright, change Mew's max to 750, and change what Myst says to change it to to 749. If i'm overdoing it or overstepping any bounds, please tell me - I'm basing all of these things off of ratios I could get from the 240ml measurement you gave me.

I'd say you're gold! Thank you for your help, Zangoose. :D

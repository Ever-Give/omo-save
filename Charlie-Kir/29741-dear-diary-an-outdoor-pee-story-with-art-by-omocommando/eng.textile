I did something very naughty today, but it was ever so exciting that I must write about it. I was walking in the school grounds during morning recreation with Elizabeth when she told me she needed to use the lavatory. We were far away from the school house and indeed the privies, right on the edge of the grassland where Clara got lost that time. Anyway, I told Elizabeth that she should wee in the long grass. She found it funny, but the idea of it gave me a really exciting feeling.

The grass is so long at the moment that when you stand in it it comes right up to your bottom, so none of the other girls could see below our skirts, not that there was anyone else around anyway. So Elizabeth went and stood in the long grass with her feet wide apart and started giggling. I could hear her wee splashing all over the place, and I was so excited that I wanted to do it too. Elisabeth took off my drawers and rolled down my stockings for me, then held up my skirt to watch and giggle as I let my wee spurt all over the grass. It was such fun, and when Elisabeth used her handkerchief to wipe me dry it tingled and felt really good.

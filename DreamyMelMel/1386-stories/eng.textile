Okay... So I have been sooo UNINSPIRED lately and I hate it!!!!

I really want to write more stories so if anyone has any basic ideas then I could write you a story!

I am not really familiar with anime characters so that could be hard but just lemme know!!

Random idea for you!

How about a girl who is visiting another town or city with her family (perhaps they were visiting relatives or something) and part way through, they get separated? She just decides to make the best of it and explore the city on her own, figuring she'll meet up with her family somehow. Eventually, finds herself getting desperate to use the bathroom.

Does that help get your creative juices flowing?

Thats a good idea. I might just try that

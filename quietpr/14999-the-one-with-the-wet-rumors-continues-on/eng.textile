I just thought I would leave a stub thread over here in the forum to make note of the fact that I have continued my "Friends" fanfic of late, though chapter entries are fewer and further between due to a very busy career transition/new marriage/new place to live summer for me. I just posted the 11th chapter in the Fiction tab, so those of you who don't regularly check that section out and are interested...it's over there.

I have had more fun writing this fanfic novella than I ever have had doing fetish fanfic...it's the culmination of many of my kinky ideas about the franchise...and my evil (heh) cohort Vexer has been adding some of his ideas into the mix as well to keep the creative juices flowing...so check it out. :)

I think my next project, once this one is complete, will not be fanfic, though it may have some sci-fi elements to it, I want to practice creating characters, rather than just using established ones. :) My wife, after reading some of the fetish fiction I had on my Kindle by other authors said she wanted to see me try writing my own because, and I quote, "You're a better writer than these guys, and you can use better language that won't seem so harsh!" So...the next thing I do will probably be my own characters and be considerably softer in tone. This story covers a range of tones (though I try to keep it respectful) that are dictated by the characters with which I'm working...my own characters can evolve the way I want them to.

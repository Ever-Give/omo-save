Let me tell you how it all started for me. I was a child, not long in school, so I would have been five or six years old when I first realised I was interested in wetting myself. The younger kids in our street played in the lane at the back of the houses. Normal little kids stuff, and I was out there with the rest. One day something made me notice my friend Martin, a boy who was a year younger than me. Liquid was running down his leg. As I came to attention, I saw glistening piss, almost glowing in the sunshine, bulging and bursting through the front of his navy-blue shorts. I watched, as his piss flowed freely, Martin playing on regardless. I could hardly believe my eyes. Wet grey socks, fresh piss trickling out of the holes in his red plastic sandals and soaking away into the dusty-mud surface of the lane.

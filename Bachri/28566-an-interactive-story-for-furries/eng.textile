I just yesterday began an interactive story over on FurAffinity, anybody is allowed to come over and make votes. It doesn't have a set character or setting- yet. The first segment is where people will vote on these. Read the rules and Character Sheet voting options before deciding weather to join or not. If you do want to join and be part of the vote, you will likely need to make an account on FurAffinity if you don't yet have one, as I won't be accepting votes from here.

This story is not limited to Omorashi and wetting, sexual and NSFW themes can occur based on vote results.

Sorry guys, I'm not really any kind of tech support for FurAffinity... the only thing I can really suggest to fix the problem is that you need to be logged in and you need to have access to mature material on the website.

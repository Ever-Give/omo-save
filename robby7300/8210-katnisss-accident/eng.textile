I'm trying to sound as nice as possible when say this so don't misinterpret it as rudeness. When you write a story you should have all your ideas predetermined. I wouldn't recommend posting things under 500 words otherwise it just seems like spam. Be much more descriptive, don't just say she felt and urge to pee suddenly then next thing you know she starts spurting. She would have known she needed to pee for a while if tripping releases an amount of urine.

Also make sure to capitalize in proper areas, don't shorten words and double space after periods. That's all I can tell you since I'm out of ideas.

Ok, like I said I'm not trying to be mean. Don't be so quick to swat away constructive criticism. If you have a bad time remembering ideas write them all down before you write the actual story. If you really are new here, I'm just trying to help you fit in. If your posts are generally this short, stop writing stories and move into the roleplaying realm because then short posts will actually fit in and you can still tell the same story so long as you find a helpful partner and you want to continue your story.

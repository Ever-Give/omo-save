@ Necro Dragon: To avoid giving spoilers I'm going to say yes and no. Yes, I've got things planned and no, I'm not telling anyone what they are. I like cracking down on any potential spoiler releases as I think that, if I told most of the story through spoilers, no one will read it.

@Lucifer Angel: Chapter 13 will primarily focus on a single character and reveal some of their story. It's needed to go with what I planned. Chapter 14 will be another whole cast chapter omitting the previously focused character. Chapter 15 will possibly bring an end to the night if all goes to plan. Regarding Brooke's mother finding everything out, it's highly likely. Regarding Emily, I'm not introducing her yet but she may appear in a small cameo. For now I'm going to focus on the pieces already in play.

I used to be quite an active contributor on here, and really enjoyed writing and the engagement with the audience too.

After quite a journey of exploration and discovery about myself, I’ve kinda made my peace with the fact the stories I wrote no longer have a place here, but I’m finding more and more that I miss writing and I miss the connection I had with those who read my work. I often used to say that the stories wrote themselves, the characters getting into my head and doing their own thing, and it was great fun to see what the outcome was.

I’ve tried a couple of times writing different things, even pushing well out of my comfort zone and trying to write in a completely different style, but it just didn’t click in anything like the same way and it became forced, a chore rather than something I enjoyed, and I know that showed in the quality of the writing too.

So, inspire me! What would you like to see me write and, particularly those of you familiar with my writing style, what kind of subject/storyline do you think I’ll get along well enough with to be able to run with it like I used to? I know (well, hope, at least) that some people used to enjoy work as much as I enjoyed writing it, so I'm really hoping to find a way back, somehow.

Thanks!

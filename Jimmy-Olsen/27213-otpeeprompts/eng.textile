I'd like everybody to be aware of a great writing resource: http://otpeeprompts.tumblr.com/

It's a blog that posts scenarios for omorashi shipfics without limiting them to specific characters or universes. There are also some full fics that followers wrote based on the prompts. You really need to check this out if you haven't already.

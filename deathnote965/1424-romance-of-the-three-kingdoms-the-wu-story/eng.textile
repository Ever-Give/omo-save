Prologue:

For those of you who do not know anything about Romance Of The Three Kingdoms, try to bare with me, i will do the best i can, also to note, this story will be partial history, and partially fiction, for those who care, i will indicate when the switch occurs, hopefully i will have one of these stories for each of the 4 kingdoms, Wu, Wei, Shu, and Jin (suggestions for which girls from each kingdom i should use are welcome, this one with Wu will feature the two Qiao's) and maybe multiple chapters for each if people show interest, i will post links to pictures of the characters as i really don't like describing characters if i don't have to....

Cao Cao: http://dynastywarriors.neoseeker.com/wiki/Cao_Cao

Zhuge Liang: (The Sleeping Dragon) http://koei.wikia.com/wiki/Zhuge_Liang

Zhou Yu: http://koei.wikia.com/wiki/Zhou_Yu

Sun Ce: (Even though he's historically dead by this point, i find it wrong to write an omo story about his wife without his involvement somehow.....) http://koei.wikia.com/wiki/Sun_Ce

Xiao Qiao: (this could possibly be consider semi-loli as she was only 16 when all of this began.....and her personality is very whiny and childish) http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://mobile360.org/wp-content/gallery/wall-320x480-1/three-kingdoms-xiao-qiao-f.jpg&imgrefurl=http://mobile360.org/news/17915-1233-iphone-wallpaper-gallery-vol-1%3Fnggpage%3D9%26show%3Dgallery%26pid%3D7074%26replytocom%3D2579&h=480&w=320&sz=196&tbnid=gj3zB4yNAeL9VM:&tbnh=275&tbnw=183&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dxiao%2Bqiao%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&zoom=1&q=xiao+qiao&hl=en&usg=__xz5-tLEqsJk_6TctGOkHA_q5Gg8=&sa=X&ei=QrnDTdTrD4Py0gGos_mjCA&sqi=2&ved=0CBoQ9QEwBg

Da Qiao: http://koei.wikia.com/wiki/Da_Qiao

That being said, and the links being posted, i will get around to updating the first chapter when i have time,as it will have to be a bit lengthy to give the gist of the history and what will be going on

I'm thinking of doing it over the events leading up to Chi Bi/Red Cliffs when Cao Cao wanted the Qiao's.....having them taken prisoner or something, haven't completely thought it through yet lol

I love the Dynasty Warrior games. I would, however, like to know what the real Lu Bu was like... I mean, he couldn't really have been a one man army, could he? Anyway, I can't wait to read this.

}}

His legend of being the strongest throught the land probably made him a one man army, it's psychological, if the enemy believes Lu Bu is a one man army, then he is, though he had to have alot of skill regardless because he held of the three brothers before retreating

Hey, I say don't worry about people knowing the story. It will be your story anyway, or what's the point in retelling Lo Guan Zhong's? Spoken as someone whose written a novel based on the same material. ;D Good luck and have fun!

Yes, you do have a point, thanks, i guess i won't spend as much time telling the story as doing the story so much as actually getting the story done. I guess it will just be more enjoyable for those that know everything about it XD

Why hasn't anyone told me Xiao Qiao was missing a link?....

Sorry if this sucks, it's like.....4 in the morning, and i want to at least get the first chapter out so i know this idea won't die on me XD But here it goes, enjoy (for those that know what i'm talking about, Sun Ce has taken the place on Sun Quan, for those who don't, disregard this message)

Chapter 1: Prelude to the disaster of Chi Bi (part 1)

After Sun Ce failed to seize the capital of Xu Chang where he was terribly wounded in battle, the kingdom of Wu suffered a great loss of troops and morale was low all around causing Sun Ce to fall into a state of depression that even his best friend Zhou Yu couldn't snap him out of, he had been bed-ridden for days, never leaving the safety of his room, his sworn brother, Zhou Yu was always by his side, constantly concerned for his friends health

"Hey.....Zhou Yu?"

"Yes my lord?"

"What that sorcerer said has really been bugging me lately....."

"You mean the one from Xu Chang?"

"Yeah....nevermind....it's nothing Zhou Yu" What did he mean those that i would only live half of the normal life-span a normal person would?

"Sun Ce.....Sun Ce!"

"Hm? Oh, what is it Zhou Yu"

"We've just recieved a letter from Shu....apparently they want to ally with us since neither of our great countries have the power to face Cao Cao"

"Ah.....lord Liu Bei.....does he wish to have an audience with me?"

"Not quite my lord, the letter was from Shu, but this is not his hand-writing, it appears that the one who wrote this letter was Zhuge Liang"

"The Sleeping Dragon Eh? Lord Liu Bei does live up to his reputation....to think he could acquire the services of the Dragon is quite amazing"

"What do you wish to do my lord?"

"Let's meet with this Zhuge Liang person and see what he proposes we do"

"Yes my lord, i shall take my leave, i will have thee meeting arranged when i return"

Before Zhou Yu could leave, Sun Ce suddenly grabbed his shoulder "Zhou Yu, be careful....if the Dragon lives up to his reputation, he could be a danger to all of Wu in the future"

"I am quite aware my lord, you just get your much needed rest and leave this to me"

"Haha, thanks again Zhou Yu, i don't know where i would be without you, your always there to dig me out of my messes"

And with this goodbye from his friend, he set out to bring Zhuge Liang back to Wu to meet with Sun Ce

"It's quite a lovely day....i have a bad feeling about this...." Zhou Yu muttered to himself, strolling over to a carriage that was waiting to take him to Shu "What is that Zhuge Liang plotting?...."

"Sir! are you ready to go?" the driver called out to Zhou Yu

"Ah, yes, i'm going to take a nap.....Do you mind waking me when we get there?"

"Yes sir"

But Zhou Yu didn't hear him, he had already fallen asleep after being awake for days at Sun Ce's side. The driver had woken him up when they reached Shu, just as he had asked, but when they arrived, it was not The Sleeping Dragon waiting for them, but Cao Cao himself who had already destroyed the whole country of Shu"

"What?! No! How can this be!" Zhou Yu cried out "All of Shu? Destroyed? Cao Cao!!"

"Hahahaha, what's wrong boy? Did you really think you could take me down with the help of Liu Bei?" Cao Cao said, while turning his back to Zhou Yu and motioning at the burning remains of Shu "Watch it all burn boy, and know that next is Wu, you are powerless to stop my conquest! Ahahahahaha!!"

"No....Cao Cao you monster! You cannot be allowed to rule this land! I won't let you! Your rule of tyranny is not what this land needs! This land needs rulers like lord Liu Bei and Sun Ce to guide them into everlasting peace!"

"Then come at me boy....IF you think you can win...."

"Cao Cao....." Zhou Yu muttered, fighting back tears "I will not let this fate befall Wu as well! Aaahhh!!!" Zhou Yu lunged at Cao Cao with his sword, piercing it straight through his heart, but to his amazement, Cao Cao vanished, as if he were never there to begin with

Moments later Zhou Yu woke up, panting and breathing heavily, and he saw before him, the land of Shu, still the way it was and always has been

"Was it all....just a dream?"

"Sir, are you okay? We've arrived at our destination"

"Aah, yes, i'm fine, just a bad dream is all, thank you for asking" he said, hopping out of the carriage

Finally i get to meet the famous Zhuge Liang, i wonder how this will play out, he thought to himself, stepping into the land of Shu and approaching the castle where he would meet The Sleeping Dragon himself

### End ###

(I am not pleased at all with how i described things, NEVER write a story while your trying to stay awake XD ((Luckily there's not much to describe when 2 people are having boring talks about being on the brink of war, eh?? lol Though i could of added some hand gestures or movements....)) however, i've never tried doing character dialogues the way i did now, and actually find it much easier, if nobody has any issues with the way it is set up, i'll probably continue doing it that way)

Yeah, I hope mine will be more enjoyable to those people who will recognize what I've done. But I'm also somewhat scared there will be those purest who will look at it and say: "That's not right! That was done by Zhuge Liang and he's not even in this story!" *Gasp* I really want ROTK fans to like my book, but I'm not just hoping for their approval. There's a much wider world out there, and if you write the best story you can, it's sure to attract their attention. I'm sorry, I haven't had time yet to check out your links, but I really want to. Don't take 'em down, kay?

Ampharos from Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon is heading back to Lively town after traveling somewhere by himself and gets lost (because we all know how he is) and to make matters worse he had a lot to drink earlier and it's finally starting to catch up to him. And unfortunately for him there's no place where he can relieve himself. By the end his bladder is full to bursting but he is able to make it back to the Expedition Society headquarters and get to the bathroom just as he is minutes/moments away from losing control.

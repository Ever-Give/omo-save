This guy won. http://blackestknight049.deviantart.com/art/Sakura-s-Return-to-Preschool-565114994

Judge said some nice things about mine though^^ http://tamaeftt.deviantart.com/journal/Story-Contest-Winners-566650140

Judge said he was more in tune with the show, and that I went all Dr. Who hehe i'm happy with 2nd place, I still won a one character commission, unfortunately only 1st place got the 2 character commission so I can't do my Emily/Anna idea. Maybe I can work out a 2 character commission in exchange for a story.

Well, that ends the preview day. If we return tomorrow, there will be another chance to assess the slaves on display before they are auctioned.

I think I will start a new thread for that.

Which slave girl will attract the most bidders? (Let me know, it will help me understand which parts of the story are most successful.)

I had a bit of a continuity problem while writing the auction day itself, but I think I've now resolved it (I was about to ask for suggestions). I'll now start posting the rest of the story.

Readers: if you have any ideas about what may happen at the auction, or after, please do say. It may help me develop this.

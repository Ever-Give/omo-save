Chapter One: Locked in the basement.

Serenity walks in to her friend, Lonnie, passed out from too much to drink.

"Ah yes, he is passed out. Can't risk him waking up now, better get him out of his jeans and shirt and down to the basement."

She carries him down to a bed where he is tied down and can't move. The basement looks more like a soundproof dungeon where no one can hear what is going on from inside or outside. Serenity locks the door and gets her watch out: "23:03, that means it took me 18 minutes to get him down here and tied up. That will be good to know."

"Well it's time to get a good night of sleep. Good night Lonnie, you're going to be in hell by 9 AM tomorrow."

How is that for a start? Tell me if it is good to begin or do I need some more things added. I read every single one.

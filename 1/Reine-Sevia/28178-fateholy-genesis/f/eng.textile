Chapter 1: Genesis

It was peaceful night, so it had seemed. The night was silent and the wind blew softly in the air. Some could say it was too peaceful, but supernatural events were plaguing this city known as, Fuyuki. Lately, there had been numerous deaths of people in random areas of the city. These people had the oddest wounds. Some had been pierced by some sort of great weapon while some were sliced in half or poisoned. One could say it was supernatural. The public rolled these murders by saying it was homicide because the supernatural doesn't exist. Little did they know that there was a bigger picture that they were missing.

That's when the silence of the night broke when a large red barrier engulfed part of the city. Inside this barrier, stood two young males gazing at each other. One of the males wore a mask with only one eye hole. The mask also had strange symbols and carvings as if some one long ago put ancient writing onto it. The other male had white spiked hair with tan skin and yellow eyes. Inside this barrier, it had seemed time had stopped and they were the only ones moving inside this space. Only one question remained. What was the purpose of this barrier?

"A bounded field. Are you the one who set this up?" The white haired male spoke up.

"Yes, I set this barrier up. I came here to kill you, not to have a chit-chat. I'm low on time right now... so I suggest you prepare yourself. I don't wanna kill you without the clashing of our weapons." The mask man shouted as he revealed on his right hand a strange red marking. The marking then glowed as a strange black lightning-curved sword appeared into his hand.

"Ahh! You must be the Genesis Killer, Siege. I shall introduce myself! My name is Kasai Ichiga!" The male then examined Siege's weapon then began to talk once more, "Hmmm... I recognize your weapon. It is the, Keris mpu Gandering. So you are indeed the Genesis Killer. Since you brought the field up just for me, I will accept your duel. The only thing is... I won't be the one dying here tonight." The white haired male smiled as he too showed his strange marking and summon a flaming sword to his side.

In a blink of an eye, Siege rushed towards him with great speed and clashed with the flaming sword. Kasai and Siege then began to clash swords with each other before pushing themselves back a few feet. A grin came across Siege's face while his sword engulfed in a blackish glow.

"Black Extinction!" Siege shouted as he sliced his sword in a forward motion. As soon as he did this a large crescent shockwave rushed towards Kasai. The shockwave hit the flaming sword before being sliced in half and exploding on both sides. Dust covered the area for a brief moment before dissipating and revealing Siege reading his black bow and using his sword as a arrow.

"No... way... you have-" Kasai was interupped by Siege fired his sword as it hit Kasai dead on into the chest. Siege then rushed forward and knocked the sword further in his chest. This created a chain reaction and dark energy released and slowly made its way into his body. Kasai's eyes turned black while Siege chuckled.

"Yes, I have two weapons. Actually, I have more than two! I have a total of five! So either way, you were going to die before we even fought! I would of prolonged this further, but I have places to be."

"In...human... wielding five weapons... its impossible..." Kasai said with a restrained voice.

Siege chuckled as he slowly walked away from Kasai, "Fools shall die as fools." Siege then snapped his fingers as the darkness inside his body exploded him into ash. Siege then stopped and clenched his fist while he watched his barrier slowly fade away from the sky.

"If I have to become a murderer for your sake... I will. I will do whatever it takes to win this war even if it means staining my hands with blood." Siege then made his weapon disappeared as he walked down the street and disappeared into the shadows.

"Wake up, Kurai! Wake up!" The sound of a pestering child's voice filled the air.

"Avalon... its not even time for school yet. Why are you waking me up at this hour?" The young man in bed sighed and rubbed his eyes.

Avalon bit her lip, "Well, you take forever to get ready! Plus, your supposed to walk me to school!" Avalon nagged in her childish voice.

"Uggg!" Kurai let out a moan before lightly pushing her off the bed before getting out of bed himself. He then yawned as he slowly fixed his black spiky hair in the mirror. Avalon then got up from the ground and looked at him with her cute and innocent red eyes.

"That was mean, Kurai!" Avalon's expression changed from sad to mad.

Kurai sighed as he slowly put on his black school uniform and fasted his neck tie. He then pat his sister on the head and smiled, "I'm sorry. I'm just a bit tired that's all." He then began to stroke her green hair before remembering he had to walk her to school. Kurai quickly made breakfast for him and his sister before rushing out the door with a biscuit in his mouth.

"I will pick you up around 3 when I get out of school. I will meet you at the gate of your school to walk you home." Kurai told Avalon.

Avalon smiled as she then noticed a strange red mark on his right hand,"Hey, Kurai... what's that strange thing on your hand?" Avalon asked him as she pointed to the strange red mark on his hand.

Kurai analyzed it and came to a conclusion, "Maybe its just a scratch when I woke up this morning. It should heal in a day or so. There is no need to worry."

That's when a girl appeared in front of Kurai. She wore a rather revealing attire under a black trench coat and red scarf consisting of a blue bikini top, short blue Jean shorts, and for an odd reason, no shoes. Her hair was flaming red kept cut close to her head, in a very high and tight style while still maintaining a feminine look. Her eyes were fierce green, with a glint in her eye that could lead any man to his death. She then revealed her left hand which had a strange symbol of a cross and nails on the sides and bottom of it. The symbol then glowed as the surrounding area and sky turned crimson.

"Who are you? What is going on?"

"My name is Aeleif Dullahan... you won't be alive much longer so I really had no need to give my name. So prepare yourself!" The girl told him as her symbol glowed once more before a medium size yellow spear appeared in her hand. She than spun it around rapidly before getting into her fighting stance.

What.. is happening... what is going to happen to me.... am I going to die?

###

Well I need to add onto this part of the chapter, but I'm stuck and don't know how to bring out my idea ;-;

*003*2015-10-17 18:29

{{

So. its another fate/stay spin off I take it?

}}

Well Kuro, this is what I as working on. This was my original concept idea but I put it in the Fate Universe, the only difference is between mine and Fate is simple. They are fighting for the Grail and for my original... I couldn't find what they were fighting for so I'm writing this, only to edit it when I'm done so it won't have a Fate Concept.

*005*2015-10-17 18:58

{{

So, your own original characters are showing up or will other's from the Fate Universe show up as well?

}}

Nope just their weapons!

"If I have to become a murderer for your sake... I will. I will do whatever it takes to win this war even if it means staining my hands with blood." Siege then made his weapon disappeared as he walked down the street and disappeared into the shadows.

The sound of fire raged throughout the area. The sounds of screams and pain could only be heard. There stood a young man in the vast barren field. Devoid of any grass the sky above looked like it was on fire. The very air was hot and humid and every breath that even the young man took, it burned the inside of his mouth. As far as his eyes could see there was nothing but vast flames upon flames. They danced and flickered as they moved across the ground. It was right then when a faint voice could be heard from the area.

"Gram!"

Kurai, looked around "Is anyone here?" The young shouted, After having brought his hands up to his mouth. Waiting a few moments nothing came back to him. But he did hear the same voice from before again.

"Gram, Gram..." the voice repeated.

He then took a step forward. The heat was getting to him his whole body was hot he felt hot. It hurt to speak or even to move as a hot dry wind blew across the field. Covering his face with his arms the voice he heard three times now repeated itself once more.

"Gram, Gram, Gram!"

The voice echoed through out the field and his mind. The young man brought his hands to his ears to try and block the voice. "What, does that even mean?" He shouted, looking around again for where this strange echoing voice was coming from. His search this time revealed something not too far into the distance he could see a small hazy shape. One step forward and then another he took using every last bit of strength he had left. The hazy shape soon became clearer to him the closer he approached it.

"Gram, Gram, Gram, GRAM!"

The voice grew louder and at this very moment he could now fully see what appeared. To be a sword stuck into the ground the sword is a double-edged blade nearly as long as a draich, slightly wider at the point than at the hilt to give the weapon extra to cut with. Its blade was sheathed in a scabbard of black lacquered bone, chased with gold and ornamented with fiery rubies. The weapon's hilt was long and slim, built for two hands and wrapped with dark leather. A large cabochon ruby, like a dragon's eye, gleamed at the point where hilt met blade. It glimmered with power, radiating from the entire blade in waves of invisible heat. The blade has a black finish its edge shone like fire in the gloom.

"GRAM, GRAM, GRAM, GRAM, GRAM!"

The voice repeated once more so loud that the young man dropped to his knees screaming in pain. Though the pain only seemed to last for a mere moment before completely vanishing. The young man struggled to get back to his feet. Then without warning he reached out towards the sword in the ground and grasped its handle before a odd familiar voice was heard.

"Kurai, Kurai, KURAI!WAKE UP!" a female voice nagged.

Kurai suddenly grew confused and his dream world shattered to pieces. As he was shaken wide awake by the source of that female voice.

"Wake up, Kurai! Wake up!" The sound of a pestering child's voice filled the air.

"Avalon... its not even time for school yet. Why are you waking me up at this hour?" The young man in bed sighed and rubbed his eyes.

Avalon bit her lip, "Well, you take forever to get ready! Plus, your supposed to walk me to school!" Avalon nagged in her childish voice.

"Uggg!" Kurai let out a moan before lightly pushing her off the bed before getting out of bed himself. He then yawned as he slowly fixed his black spiky hair in the mirror. Avalon then got up from the ground and looked at him with her cute and innocent red eyes.

"That was mean, Kurai!" Avalon's expression changed from sad to mad.

Kurai sighed as he slowly put on his black school uniform and fasted his neck tie. He then pat his sister on the head and smiled, "I'm sorry. I'm just a bit tired that's all." He then began to stroke her green hair before remembering he had to walk her to school. Kurai quickly made breakfast for him and his sister before rushing out the door with a biscuit in his mouth.

"I will pick you up around 3 when I get out of school. I will meet you at the gate of your school to walk you home." Kurai told Avalon.

Avalon smiled as she then noticed a strange red mark on his right hand,"Hey, Kurai... what's that strange thing on your hand?" Avalon asked him as she pointed to the strange red mark on his hand.

Kurai analyzed it and came to a conclusion, "Maybe its just a scratch when I woke up this morning. It should heal in a day or so. There is no need to worry."

That's when a girl appeared in front of Kurai. She wore a rather revealing attire under a black trench coat and red scarf consisting of a blue bikini top, short blue Jean shorts, and for an odd reason, no shoes. Her hair was flaming red kept cut close to her head, in a very high and tight style while still maintaining a feminine look. Her eyes were fierce green, with a glint in her eye that could lead any man to his death. She then revealed her left hand which had a strange symbol of a cross and nails on the sides and bottom of it. The symbol then glowed as the surrounding area and sky turned crimson.

"Who are you? What is going on?"

"My name is Aeleif Dullahan... you won't be alive much longer so I really had no need to give my name. So prepare yourself!" The girl told him as her symbol glowed once more before a medium size yellow spear appeared in her hand. She than spun it around rapidly before getting into her fighting stance.

What is this... am... I going to die... Am I going to die by the hands of a girl.. I just met with a strange weapon in her hand?

"Summon it... summon the sword..." The mysterious voice echoed from his mind.

What sword?

That's when Aelief rushed forward with great speed and prepared to thrust her spear into his shoulder. Kurai swiftly dodged it before hearing the voice once more.

"Gram... GRAM GRAM! Summon it... Summon Gram... Call to it!"

Kurai gulped as Aelief tried thrusting at his shoulder once more. Kurai swiftly dodged to the right once more before he backed up a bit and started to huff. This didn't stop Aelief from charging at him. Kurai then caught glimpse of his symbol glow before Aelief came towards him at point blank. Kurai suddenly realized that maybe this voice he is hearing maybe his only way to stay alive right now. Kurai clenched his fist while Aelief prepared to strike his heart.

"Your mine!" Aelief shouted as forced her spear forward.

"Come forth to me, Gram!" Kurai shouted as red aura shot out of his hand. Kurai reached out his hand while red flurries from the aura appeared in the shape of a sword. This didn't phase Aelief... she had seen much more flashy light show then what was happening. Kurai grasped the flurries and it materialized a mysterious two edge blade in his hand. Quickly, Kurai swung the spear away with his blade and jumped back a few feet to give him distance from Aelief.

Aelief's eyes grew as she looked at the blade. It was raging with a red aura that covered the whole blade. She then began to tremble as words of fear came from her mouth, "It can't be... that's..." She was then caught off by Kurai, who head heard this.

He swung his sword multiple times and then grasped it with both hands before putting the sword in a stance in front of his body. "Gram!" Kurai grinned.

OCs:

Siege, Kurai, Avalon and Kasai: Reine Sevia

Aelief: Revolver Sushi-Sama Senpai

Next time:

"What a unfortunate event for us to meet. I'm not the person to show pity for people... so I will let you go this once without a fight. Just know in the future I will kill you like I've done to the people before you. As for you, Overseer! I will let you shield him this once because I have respect for you... once he gets out of here, he is fair game for the rest of the masters who want to kill him!"

Kurai growled as the masked man slowly walked away from him and then disappeared. The Overseer then turned to Kurai and spoke, "Before I let leave, I want you to heed my advice. Don't trust anyone in this war and always be prepared to fight in any predicament and in any place!

}}

Yep, this is true but both Gae Dearg and Gae Buide are wielded by different masters. One has Gae Bolg and Gae Dearg. One has Gae Buide and Mystic Code: Epsilon.

Last time:

"You're mine!" Aeleif shouted as forced her spear forward.

"Come forth to me, Gram!" Kurai shouted as red aura shot out of his hand. Kurai reached out his hand while red flurries from the aura appeared in the shape of a sword. This didn't phase Aeleif... she had seen much more flashy light show then what was happening. Kurai grasped the flurries and it materialized a mysterious two edge blade in his hand. Quickly, Kurai swung the spear away with his blade and jumped back a few feet to give him distance from Aeleif.

Aeleif's eyes grew as she looked at the blade. It was raging with a red aura that covered the whole blade. She then began to tremble as words of fear came from her mouth, "It can't be... that's..." She was then caught off by Kurai, who head heard this.

He swung his sword multiple times and then grasped it with both hands before putting the sword in a stance in front of his body. "Gram!" Kurai grinned.

###

"The blade of Siegfried himself... G-Gram," Aeleif stuttered. "No matter how flashy that weapon of yours is, you're still gonna die!" She yelled as she swung her spear towards Kurai.

Aelief aimed her spear at Kurai's chest. It was a quick thrust, intending to end the fight just as quickly as it begun. But, at the last moment, Gram parried the thrust, knocking the spear tip to his right. Aeleif pulled back and snarled in anger.

As Kurai held Gram in hand, the hilt felt hot to the touch, as if the steel was still fresh from the forge. The warmth sank into his skin, suffusing his muscles with power. He marveled at the blade's black finish.

Aeleif was moving once more, her spear reaching for his throat. Kurai brought Gram up in the nick of time, barely deflecting the lethal strike, but there was no time to recover. Aeleif switched targets and began a series of deadly thrusts at his face, chest, and groin. She never stopped moving, flowing towards him like a dancer and making a lethal move with each and every step.

Kurai had no time to be afraid. Being that he was scared for his life, he didn't wish to die. He still wasn't really sure as to what the hell was really going on. Gram seemed to move of its own accord, matching Aeleif blow for blow. Her speed and grace were devastating and Kurai was hard pressed to counter it.

As the battle dragged on, Kurai slowly began to read Aeleif's movements. He seemed to know where she was going to attack and would parry the strike aimed right at him. Just how this was happening was a mystery could; Gram be giving him this ability? Kurai didn't seem to take notice of this just yet, though with each parry Kurai made, he only seemed to upset Aeleif further. How could a mere novice like Kurai be besting her? To her he was moving like someone who knew how to use a sword. But how could that be? Just mere moments ago Kurai could barely handle the sword, and now here he was moving like he knew how. Aeleif paused in her attack for a moment to address Kurai.

"Hey, you should be dead by now, how are you blocking my attacks?" Aeleif asked.

Hearing her voice seemed to break Kurai out of the small trance he as the fight was going on. "Huh, what?" Kurai asked with a look of genuine confusion on his face.

Not getting the answer that she wished to know along with seeing an opening, Aeleif lunged forward, pushing the blade towards Kurai at incredible speed. Time seemed to suddenly slow down to a crawl Kurai tried to bring Gram up again to defend himself though was moving far too slowly. Just when all hope seemed lost and Aeleif's spear was right about to pierce Kurai's chest, a sudden bolt of violet lightning shot down from the very skies themselves, knocking up a wave of smoke which blinded both Kurai and Aeleif, both of them staggering backwards.

A few moments seemed to pass as the smoke began to clear. Standing in the middle of the pair appeared to be a young man with short dark hair and a pair of crimson eyes. He wore a black tight tank top which seems to fit him pretty comfortably. On top of the shirt he wore a jacket of some kind and lacking sleeves, the entire jacket being a dark purple hue. He wore some strange looking baggy black pants, and his tank top is tucked neatly under his pants so his shirt fits him a bit more tightly. The outfit also included tall, black boots which buckle, and come over top his pants coming up past his ankles almost halfway up to his knees which seemed to almost way a ton from the looks of them. On his left side was a long great katana which was in a dark purple sheath.

"W-who the hell are you?" Aeleif asked in surprise. Moving her head, she took this newcomer in from head to toe with her eyes. The young man said nothing, his gaze seemed to be fixed on Gram, which Kurai still held in his hand.

"So, Gram has been summoned." The young man replied evenly.

Kurai didn't saying anything, simply taking in what was said. It appeared that another person knew about the sword he held, but how could that be? Just who was this person who stood before him?

"Hey, I asked you a question, who are you!" Aeleif yelled at the young man.

"Kairos!" The young man spoke.

Hearing the name took Aeleif by complete surprise. "K-Kairos… a-as in the E-Everchosen?" Aeleif stammered. Kairos didn't answer, instead he reached with his right hand and pulled his katana from its sheath. A plume of white fire raced across the very blade before vanishing. A look of anger flashed across her face when she got no answer in return. She had heard stories of Kairos, they spoke that he was a gifted swordsmen from the Kuroyami family who was known to be quite famous, seeing as the members of his family were gifted in swordplay.

Aeleif brought her spear around and swung it at Kairos' head. He simply dodged to his right then to his left as the spear was swung at him once more. It wasn't until Aeleif moved the spear back for another attack did Kairos make his move. Quickly, he made two fluid swings, one aimed at her legs, the second at her chest. Aeleif brought her spear down and parried the first attack but was two slow to block the second. She felt the tip of the blade slice across her chest. Jumping backwards Aeleif looked down; a small cut was visible between her breasts, and a small dribble of blood flowed down. Second her bikini top had been cut clean through to show off a small pair of breasts.

Crying out in surprise and embarrassment, Aeleif attacked once more with a series of quick swings and thrusts, all aimed at Kairos' chest and arms. He dodged them with little to no effort only to counterattack twice more with two fluid strikes. The first caught Aeleif on her right leg while the second formed a small cut above her left eye. Blood flowed down from the cut, getting into her eye. She brought her hand up and wiped the blood away.

Aeleif was at a clear disadvantage in this new battle. Kairos was far more skilled in combat than she, and if this fight were to drag on any longer, she might die. She didn't want this nor did she wish to retreat from the battle. If she could turn this battle to her favor… If she could just land a single strike… However, she never got the chance, Kairos' katana was soon covered in white flames once more. He quickly swung his sword at her sending a small trail of flames flying. Aeleif spun her spear around and blocked most of the flames. Some did manage to touch her, forming small burn marks on her exposed skin.

Crying out in pain, Aelief quickly jumped backwards once more. "I'll remember this!" Aeleif shouted before retreating from the area by jumping into a tree. Kairos sheathed his sword and turned to Kurai, who had been watching the entire battle in sheer amazement.

"Who are you? What are you?" Kurai asked.

"All will be explained in due time! Come... it's time I took you to see the Overseer since I know you're dying to hear an explanation." Kairos replied.

Kairos then took Kurai to a large building nearby. He then stopped at the building's gate before speaking, "This is called the church. It was my job personally to get you here unharmed. After the Overseer is done explaining, you're fair game for the rest of us."

"Us... what do you mean by us? There are more of you!?" Kurai shivered for a moment.

Kairos nodded, "Yes, there are more of us. So go ahead on in, and just know... you owe me." Kairos then walked away as Kurai entered the church. It was an ordinary church with stain glass windows, rows of seats and a pew in the middle of the church, not to mention a cross over top of the arc on the wall above the pew. There stood a young woman, who possessed a fair complexion and lithe build. Her figure was noted to be very similar to that of a doll's, absolutely perfect and stunning. Her skin was so white and smooth that it appeared almost like she was made of porcelain. 

Black locks cascaded all the way down to her lower back while her bangs dropped to her shoulders. Her eyes, however, were cold and black eyes that glowed an eerie yellow. Her eyelashes were neatly curved, and her thin, curved eyebrows fit perfectly on her beautiful face. A small, sharp, and well-formed nose and thin, pinkish lips completes her beautiful face. She wore a pair of violet earrings on her ears, the earrings in the shape of a single crystal. She wore a black outfit: a black dress with a white collar, with puffy shoulders. Underneath the dress, she wore a gray shirt.

"Ahh, I've been expecting you," The Overseer called out as Kurai walked towards him. "My name is Ayane Suzakura. Tell me, what is your name, wielder of Genesis?"

"Kurai Sevia. So tell me "Overseer", what is this? I almost got killed in a fight a few minutes ago by a random stranger wielding a yellow spear. I was told to come to you for questions, so tell me, what the hell is going on?" He spoke up.

Ayane chuckled and replied, "This battle you find yourself caught up in... is called the Holy Grail War. This war is a ritual meant to select someone who is worthy of holding the Holy Grail. This Grail I speak of is the exact Grail from the Legend of King Arthur. If you don't believe it exists, then look at that weapon of yours. It's as real as it gets. The Holy Grail is capable of granting limitless power to the one who wins it. The Grail will grant one wish to the last master standing in the war. What is your wish, Kurai?"

Kurai stood quietly for a moment and bit his lip. "I don't have one..."

"Then you have a reason to fight. You will fight for the reason of finding what you wish for in the midst of this war. You cannot deny you are a master; the symbol on your right hand proves that you are a master. Since you're a master, you are able to summon something called Genesis. Genesis is a special type of magic that the Holy Grail gives Masters. Your symbol on your hand acts as a sheathe for your weapon when you're not using it so suspicion won't be drawn to you. This symbol allows you to summon your special weapon by your side by calling its name. I will warn you, there are people who have more than one weapon at their disposal; we call them Inhumans. It is impossible to wield more than two but some have found a way to have more weapons."

"So I can summon my weapon at will be calling its name? I still don't understand that red barrier that surrounded us during my fight, though…"

Ayane was not hesitant to reply, "It's called a bounded field. A bounded field acts as protection for area destruction and the slaughter of innocent people. It can only be used twice overall in a day, and while in the field time is stopped. The field lasts for thirty minutes and once the time is up, it will collapse. You can make a field by saying the word "field". The field will also collapse if a fight gets too intense, so be wary of it. Fighting outside of it would be-" Ayane was then interrupted by arrow shot from a distance. It was coming at a fast speed. Ayane caught it in her hand as a masked man in dark clothing walked into the church building.

"Siege..." Ayane growled.

"I'm surprised you caught that! Impressive Ayane." Siege told her as he began to walk towards her. He then turned his eyes to Kurai and chuckled, "What an unfortunate event for us to meet, novice! That arrow was aimed at you. I missed on purpose... I'm not the person to show pity for people... so I will let you go this once without a fight! Just know in the future I will kill you like I've done to the masters before you. So keep your guard up. As for you, Overseer, I will let you shield him this once because I have respect for you... but once he gets out of here, he's fair game for the rest of the masters who want to kill him!"

Kurai growled as the masked man slowly walked away from him and then disappeared. The Overseer then turned to Kurai and spoke, "Before I let leave, I want you to heed my advice. Don't involve innocent people unless you want them to get killed! Also, don't trust anyone in this war and always be prepared to fight in any predicament or place! Keep the ones you love close, because no master is safe in this war and people will do anything to have their wish granted by the Grail."

Kurai nodded as the Overseer waved goodbye while he left the church. The red sky from before quickly disappeared and went back to its usual blue color. The sound of cars moving and people walking then started to sound once more. Kurai shrugged it off and began to walk. It didn't take him long before making it to the school courtyard. Kurai then made it into his classroom and plopped down in his seat before being ambushed by a male and two girls. One had yellow eyes and white hair with white skin. The other had short dirty blond hair in a scruffy cut, gray-blue eyes much like a shark's own color with a scar across the bridge of her nose.

"Late as usual." The male then approached him. He had dirty blonde hair with brownish eyes, almost a dark orange in color. Like him, he wore the student attire for males: A white shirt, white jacket with purple around the lower wrists, and black pants.

"I got held up, Cormac, give me a break!" Kurai yawned.

"Well, look what the cat dragged in. Late as usual Kurai." Another male approached him. He had cold blue eyes with bags under it and had mismatching white hair and skin.

"This is to be expected from Kurai-kun... Honestly, he is helpless..." The white haired girl spoke up shyly.

Kurai face-palmed himself before getting up from his seat and letting out a huge sigh. "I'm not helpless... Yuki. I just have trouble getting out of bed," Kurai's face turned red. "As for you Adler... put a sock in it!"

"He's probably staying up watching 'you know what'." A male with black, scruffy hair, tan skin, and sea green eyes with a slight purple tint in them told him.

"That is not the case, Isacc!" He yelled at him, plopping back in his seat before remembering he totally ditched his sister on the way to school.

"I guess you're staying quiet today huh, Yokina." Kurai told her as she blinked her gray-blue eyes for a moment.

"I, too, had a long night, so I'm in no place to judge." After Yokina said this, the teacher came walking in the class and they then returned to their seats. Kurai put his head on his desk as the teacher began to speak, "Before we start, I would like to welcome a new student. You can come in now." The teacher said in a stern voice.

Kurai lifted his head up before his eyes grew suddenly big. "My name is Aeleif Dullahan. Nice to meet you!" She spoke with confidence and smiled.

Next time

"Your in this too! Great... today has not been my day. I'm not gonna hurt you! Your my friend!"

"There are no friends in war, Kurai-kun. If your gonna act like that then... then I'm gonna slaughter you even more. I will win the Grail for the sake of my wish... So its best... you stay quiet and don't do anything... so I can make this as quick as possible!"

"... If you wanna fight then you'll get a fight! Gram!" Kurai yelled as red flurries surrounded his hand before forming the black sword. Kurai grasped it as it transformed into the sword before. "I won't kill you, but the least I can do is defeat you with little force as possible."

"Doing that won't win the war... Prepare yourself, Kurai-kun!"

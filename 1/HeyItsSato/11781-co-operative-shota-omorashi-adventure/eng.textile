Hello everyone. I know I'm still pretty new to this forum despite being here for more than a few months by now I think. I've tried to post some things to really get myself in here, but now I have an Idea that I think many people would like.

In this thread, I'm going to structure my fiction like an adventure game, and anyone who is interested can suggest commands for the character to take on, and whichever are the more popular ones among the other readers, I will issue that command to the character and the story will play out for a while. I will try to keep this to a more worksafe type story, but if anyone suggests something that I would allow, and it does happen to be NSFW, I'll see what I can do.

The story will start with a 9-13 year old boy in a very strict boarding school, where there will be very few chances to go to the bathroom, and rules with consequences that involve missing your next break or being forbidden from the bathroom until the next morning! If enough people seem interested, I will surely begin writing. If you're interested, please reply with how old you think the boy should be: 9,10,11,12, or 13!

I hope this is the right place to post this, sorry if it's not.

There's a story I read awhile back in which a boy named Charlie/Charles or the like was sent to live with someone other than his parents. He was always holding his bladder until he wet himself, and it came to light that his military father had a rule that he could only relieve himself three times a day. So now even though he lives elsewhere, he's been primed to follow that regimen.

Anyone know where I can find that story?

Yeah, that sounds right! I distinctly remember a trip to the museum with the boys as well.

I hope someone knows!

Damn, I love your Draco... honestly the best voice for Draco I think I've seen. Not to mention how you can play Severus, but both of them combined is just mind blowing! I'd read several chapters a while back, but recently I went back and reread and read for the first time some of the chapters. I don't know if you take requests, but I do know that a Draco Malfoy omo story, even if it was just one, would be amazing. There are just not enough of him out there!

Perhaps, are you on Archive of our own? the second one shot is purely Draco, have you read it? If I write a Draco omo story, I'll put it there first, at the moment I'm in the middle of a Spiderman omo fic..your profile is Tom...so I think you'll like it, check me out if you haven't. I've got the same username there as here

I have been binging all of these chapters since I got hooked on them this morning. I love them so much I cant get enough of it! However, it is 2020 right now, and the chapter I am on was from 2012, so i assume you arent writing them anymore. Every time I finish a page, i get a pang of sadness as the numbers near the end. I hope you have continued writing either here or elsewhere, as I would absolutely LOVE to read whatever you write. The quality of writing here and the depth and detail is something that I would have expected to have to pay for. Please keep it up and best of luck to you!

Are you on the Archive? Regardless you can read as a guest. If you check on Archive of our own, and look under this same username, I have this story and the two one shots as well as a over 20+ stories featuring Harry and Severus and if your into Marvel Tony and Peter all father/son omo fics. You should definitely check it out.

Thanks for your amazing review, I’m glad you enjoyed my story!

Sorry, I loathe Hermione . Don’t like Ginny either, but she was added because a friend at the time requested it.

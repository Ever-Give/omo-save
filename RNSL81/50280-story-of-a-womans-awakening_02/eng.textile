I really hope that this is going to be continued one day. It was my absolute favorite story so far.

Thanks for that. This story isn't done yet but finding time to write is difficult. Aside from some personal stuff, Work has been throwing me all over the place this year and it's not getting any better with covid19 (I'm in the forces so when they say I need to go to sea for a month or some random base at short notice, I go). I still have plans and fully intend to get back to this. Watch this space and I will do my best.

Hey to all those following. This story is not dead, I've been working out where I want to take it, and I will continue. I'm hoping to post a new chapter in a bit. I have to go to sea soon so, like most of the story so far, I will write a lot while on patrol. A chapter or two soon, depending on sea time, then I'm off on patrol so later in the year when I'm back, the rest. I have another 8 or so chapters planned. I also have a few other ideas for either one shot stories or a few with a few chapters. Sorry to anyone waiting patiently, been a difficult couple of years, but things are starting to go ok and I'm well in the headspace to write again.

I've been reading too much TV Tropes (warning: addictive material), and just realized this is a harem plot

. Might wanna give the other characters some space to develop.

Any chance one or two of the charicters might poop their pants in the next chapter?

Considering this is a story where it has happened before, there's always that possibility (but the focus will still remain mainly on omorashi stuff). Probably not in the next chapter, though.

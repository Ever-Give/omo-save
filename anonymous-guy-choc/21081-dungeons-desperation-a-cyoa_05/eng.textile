For clarification: The cut is about an inch long on her left forearm just below the elbow, bleeding a fair amount but not gushing by any stretch of the imagination. A bad cut but not a terrible wound.

*You tear away a bit of cloth from the thin curtains of the carriage for use as a bandage and then wash it using some water from your waterskin to clean it as bets you can before rinsing off your cut and tying the makeshift bandage around it. Seeing the flowing water reminds you of your need to pee from before; pressing but not quite urgent yet. You'll need to find a proper place to let your pee out at some point, and soon. First though, you need to get your bearings again, a much more important task.*

What do you do?

(I'm not going to make any suggestions this time. Just want to try that out and see what you come up with. also, sorry for the short post; this didn't have much to talk about.)

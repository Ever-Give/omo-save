Why not a topic wherein we talk about what we like to read and/or write.

It would be a place where readers (writers being readers too,) would answer specific questions asked by writers.

Please answer as honestly as possible and feel free to ask any question you want. (as long as it's related)

I'll submit the first questions:

- How long do you want the story to be?

- Do you want the wetting scene to be the biggest part of the story or do you like to have some background about the characters and their situation before (and/or after) the wetting ?

- (For the writers): Do you enjoy setting up a complex background (including omorashi related references) or do you rather go as fast as possible to the actual wetting?

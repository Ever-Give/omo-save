In a hypothetical situation that may or may not be realistic, your middle school or high school has a bathroom policy that does not allow students to use the restroom during class time, and they are to use the facilities between classes. At most, you may be able to get one hall pass in each class per quarter or semester to use the restroom without being charged with an unexcused tardy. You have 50 minute class periods, with 5 minutes between classes, but you are not really allowed to be late either, because if you are late twice or more to the same class within a semester, you get detention, in school suspension, or Saturday school depending on how excessive it is.

First unexcused tardy (per class, per semester) is a warning, second and third is 30 minute classroom detention each time, and the fourth is a one-hour office detention. So you can’t be late, but you’re also not allowed to use the restroom during class. For boys, this might not be a huge problem very often, but for girls, this has the potential to be a real problem because since you can't use the restroom during class, many people try to go between classes, creating a possibly long line, and somebody is going to end up being late.

There are three sets of restrooms in the school. Two of the three girls restrooms have five stalls each, and the last one has three stalls in it, and the school has around 900 students.

In particular, there is a tall, skinny, blonde girl named Nicole who is a 14 year old freshman. She feels a slight urge to pee in the middle of second hour, but has to wait until the end of the period. By the end of the period, she kinds of needs to go and sees a line of at least three. So she decides to head to her locker instead to get books for her next 2 or 3 classes and hope that she can hold it through the next period.

About 10 minutes into third period, she really feels the need to go, and asks 2 or 3 times during the class if she can go to the restroom and the teacher says “No bathroom breaks, you should have gone between classes”. So she waits it out until the end of the period, and as soon as the bell rings for class to end she heads downstairs to her next class and down the hallway on the other side to get to the nearest restroom located close to her next classroom.

She has already used up her emergency restroom passes for the semester for this particular class for prior situations like this, and also have one unexcused tardy for this class. This particular restroom has 5 toilets, and she gets there within about 2 minutes so she has about 3 minutes to use the restroom and get to class on time, and she is extremely desperate to pee and about ready to pee her pants and certainly cannot wait another hour this time. She also can’t afford to be late to her next class either, and can’t use the restroom during class.

However, when she gets into this restroom, she sees that all 5 stalls are occupied and there is a line of 8 or 9 girls ahead of her that also look extremely desperate and could pee their pants any second. Not long after that, two or three more desperate girls get in line behind her.

So my question is, how realistic is this scenario? And if it is realistic, what should Nicole and the other desperate girls do in this situation?

A) Wait it out and be late

B) Ask if you can cut in line because you are desperate (the answer will probably be no)

C) Pee in the sink

D) Pull your pants and piss on the floor

E) Head to class without peeing, and pee your pants at some point during that next class

F) Other (please list in the comments)

Can someone write their own story based on this scenario?

}}

Well, I can try, but I'm sure others might have other ideas. Let's take these options one by one

A) Wait it out and be late--I suppose you could wait in line and pee and get to class late and explain the situation to your teacher later.

In this scenario, Nicole knows she’ll be late if she waits in line to use the restroom, but she can’t go during class, and she can’t make it to the next break without peeing herself. So she waits it out, and finally gets into a stall about 30 seconds before the next class is supposed to begin, coming within seconds of having an accident. She’s still peeing when the bell for class rings, so she’s late, but at least she didn’t pee herself. Meanwhile, the girls behind here in line weren’t so fortunate and 2 of them peed their pants right as Jennifer got into an open stall.

After Nicole finishes her business and washes her hands and gets to her next class, her teacher asks her why she was late. She said “I had to go to the bathroom and there was a line”, and of course the teacher says that’s “not a good enough excuse” because 5 minutes between classes is “enough” time to go to the bathroom and get to class on time. Since that was her second time being late, she has to serve a 30-minute detention after school the next day simply because she had to go to the bathroom and there was a line. She has to get her parents to sign the detention slip, and of course they are not happy with her for being late to class again.

B) Ask if you can cut in line (the answer will probably be no)--This will not work because everyone is desperate to pee and all have to get to their next classes on time.

C) Pee in the sink (or trash can)--If you pee in the sink, maintenance would probably have to come by and shut down the restroom for the rest of the day. If you pee in the trash can, others will get the same idea, and it will stink all day.

D) Pull your pants and piss on the floor--Honestly, if more girls did this right then and there, it might send a message that 5 minutes between classes is not enough time to make it to a restroom, wait in line, pee, and get to class on time.

E) Head to class without peeing, and pee your pants sometime during that next class--If you are wearing diapers or tampons or something else, it might not be as noticeable, but if you are like most people, you probably don't. If you have a chance of clothes with you, you could pee your pants and then ask to change your clothes, but most students probably don't have a spare set at school with them. So in all likelihood, you would wet your pants, and then get laughed at the rest of the day.

F) Other--I suppose one option if your class is not far away, you could quickly ask your teacher before the bell rings if you can use the restroom and there is a line, and it "might" work. However, if you've already used all of your emergency restroom passes, they might very well say "Hurry up, because if you're late, you're late". Another possible option is if you have a water bottle, to pee in that and dump the contents of that when you have a chance. But we'll assume that's not the case.

In any case, I should point out that in this case, her bladder is at 99.9% capacity and she can't wait any longer to pee, and it's questionable whether she can wait in that line without peeing herself, even if she did have enough time to wait in line, pee, and get to class on time.

I would figure that at minimum, it takes each girl a minute to enter the stall, do their business, and exit (a minute and a half or longer is probably more realistic). Out of that line of 8 or 9, even if 3 stalls suddenly open up within 10 seconds, you'll still have to wait a minute plus for the current group of 5 girls to finish their business, and another minute plus for the next group of 5 girls to finish up their business.

That puts you in line to get into the stall with about 30 seconds to go before class starts, and that's if you're lucky, and assuming you haven't already peed your pants. You try to do your business as fast as you can, but because your bladder is at full capacity, you are still peeing when the tardy bell rings, and still peeing for a solid minute after that. Meanwhile, there are 3 girls behind you in line that are still waiting for a stall to open up when the bell rings, and right as the bell rings, one or two of them have a full-blown accident right then and there.

It's interesting, because I have heard about desperate lines to the bathroom, but I don't often hear about scenarios like in school or other places where you have a limited amount of time on your break or transition time to use the restroom, and because you have to use the facilities between classes, the possibility for long lines does exist. I would like to see more situations posted like this (real or fictional), because I think this is the ultimate desperation decision. I almost made a situation where there were only three stalls available instead of five, but I wanted to start off with an example where there was at least a "fighting chance" to maybe make it to a restroom and get to class on time.

But I want to make this even more interesting. Let's suppose you rule out options B, C, and D (cutting in line, peeing in the sink, trash can, or on the floor), and you can't pee in a water bottle either. So basically, you're either going to have to pee in the toilet, or in your pants. Your bladder is at 99.9% capacity and at most can wait another 5 or 10 minutes, and the line in the restroom is at least 8 girls deep for 5 toilets. Your outfit for the day is a polo shirt and light blue jeans, and maybe a light jacket if it's a cold day. And you don't have diapers or tampons, or something else to block the flow, so if you have an accident, it will be noticeable and it will stink, and you don't have a spare set of clothes to change into. So it basically boils down to this:

1) can't be late 2) can't go during class 3) can't make it through another hour without peeing your pants 4) asking the teacher if you can go to the restroom and get to class a little late won't work because "if you're late, you're late", plus you lose valuable time having that conversation, and the line when you return to the restroom will probably be even longer.

So you'll either be late and get in trouble, or pee your pants and get made fun of.

I have actually wondered how realistic a scenario like this was in real life. Take my existing scenario, for example, but change a few things things.

1) Each girls bathroom has only three toilets instead of five.

2) For each individual class, you are allowed one unexcused tardy per semester, and one emergency bathroom pass per semester (unless you need to puke instead of pee or poo). The one exception would be if you have a "girl problem" and a doctor's note is on file, but this is rarely the case.

3) Because of the constraining factors of not being allowed to be late, and can't use the bathroom during class, and only five minutes between classes, it is essentially a race to see who can get to the bathroom first and beat the line, and the girls that had their previous class right next to a bathroom are going to have an advantage if they immediately hit the bathroom after the dismissal bell rings.

4) For the girls that had their previous class farther away from a bathroom and are desperate to pee, they pretty much have to make a beeline dash to the bathroom, somehow getting around the crowded hallway traffic, and before you can even think about doing anything else (such as your locker), you have to get to the bathroom first. So you get there, and the bathroom line is already at least 3 or 4 girls long (or possibly even 5, 6, or 7 girls long). Now, if this bathroom had something like 12 or more stalls, then a line of 3 or more might not seem that bad. But I'm thinking about a scenario where you get there with only 3 stalls, and there are already 6 or 7 girls ahead of you in line (I could have gone with something ridiculous like 12 or 13 girls ahead in line, but I wanted to make the scenario to where there was some type of time crunch but maybe a slight glimmer of hope that each girl could wait in line, pee, and get to class on time).

5) Maybe these girls ahead of you in line are not quite as desperate to pee as you are (you are like 9.5 out of 10 on the desperation scale, and absolutely can't wait another period), but there is a line for a reason, and that is that everyone needs to pee and get to their next class on time (because being late isn't allowed, and neither is going to the bathroom during class). Cutting in line is not allowed under any circumstances. It may be possible that one or more of the girls ahead of you in line will give up and give you a better chance to get into a stall and get to class on time, but I'll assume that's not the case.

6) In case you are wondering, the desperate girl waiting in line has no free tardies or emergency bathroom passes available for that class (or any class). She's already used them up because she has a small bladder (we'll use Tiffany, 14 year old freshman as an example).

7) It takes each girl a minimum of a minute to enter stall, do business, and exit stall. You may not know how soon the current group of girls will exit their stalls, but you do know that the wait time is at least two minutes before you can even think about getting a turn, plus another minute to pee.

8) Also worth noting is that peeing in the sink, trash can, floor, water bottle, desk, or chair are not options. Each girl will either pee in a toilet, or can't get there in time and pee her pants.

Part 1... who wants more?

Margaret the Estate Agent

So this is the story of the time I got to date my incredible (and this night incredibly desperate) former boss named Margaret.

I worked for a real estate development company for eight years in the early 2000s. We worked out one floor in a fairly small office building in Hartford, Connecticut. Our office consisted of about 20 cubicles and two restrooms, a mens room with a stall and a urinal and a lady’s room, which I would come to learn later, consisted of two stalls. It was a fairly evenly distributed work environment as far as genders were concerned, there being approximately ten guys and ten gals working on the team.

A word on our boss Margaret. Margaret was thirty-nine, and was a truly inspirational woman who had mastered the craft of estimates and development procedures for years. If Margaret hadn’t been working in real estate, then surely she would have made a killing in Wall Street, would have made herself an excellent career in the military, or perhaps would have even been great as a sports coach for a women’s track team. She just had an extreme commanding, go-getter attitude about her, and while was almost always positive in her disposition, was also determined to keep her expectations of those of us working beneath her, high.

Physically, Margaret was very buxom, had nice large breasts, a thin waist, and a very very large behind which she kept toned with several early morning hours spent at the gym. She had long blonde hair, handsome features and basically resembled a slightly thicker, but still toned, Gisele Bundchen in the face. Margaret liked to wear tight women’s business skirts, and often times, it was hard to avoid staring at Margaret’s rear end whenever she would strut through the office in her tight skirts, or would bend over at the waist to reach down and fill her cup at the water cooler.

When I had first joined the company, Margaret gave me and several other guys a brief tour of the office, something that had been colloquially dubbed the “two-times” tour, by people who worked in this office. Why was it called the two-times tour? I and several others were about to find out. Margaret lead us throughout the office that day in a tight, navy-blue dress that clung to her womanly ass enticingly.

“So we’ve got the invoices in this bin here, the project files in this one, and finally this one is miscellaneous.” She said pointing at several plastic bins spread along a table in one of the office rooms. “Now, which bin has the invoices?” she said, whipping around to face us young men, as we all stared up at her in silence. “What’s that? Nobody can tell me? Maybe that’s why you all should be paying a little more attention to what I’m showing you, and less attention to my butt.” Margaret said with a knowing smile. “And that’s why they call this the two-times tour, because I have to show everything two times!” Margaret said, laughing out loud. The tension in the air had been broken and we were all able to loosen up a bit more after that.

We later learned that Margaret indeed had been married, but that her husband had left her after getting caught having an affair with a young girl from Brooklyn, who worked in the same office as him, somewhere across town. I always felt that there was a flirtatiousness in the way that Margaret communicated and interacted with me, but I’m sure several other guys in the office felt the same way, most likely just wishful thinking, dreaming of bedding this sporty, blonde fox of a woman.

We had a break room directly connected to the office that had a seemingly endless supply of coffee, a vending machine, and a water cooler. Often times Margaret would meet and chat with several of us in the break room as we all shared a cup, or two, of our morning coffee while discussing where we were on the timelines of the various different projects we had underway. Margaret always seemed to have this sexy glow about her, her skin always looking incredible moist, which she explained was a result of good exercise and hydration, her 5am gym routines before work being a non-negotiable part of her day, she would explain as she would down several cups of water in the break room, following her coffee. Margaret encouraged good health, exercise, hydration, discipline as being as vital a part of succeeding in the real-estate market as studying any of the numbers. Good health meant good focus, Margaret explained.

My small office cubicle was directly across from the set of restrooms, which was very convenient for me, as I would often find myself headed to the urinal to relieve myself after the morning’s water and coffee, several times, and even found this distraction itself to be a relief from the constant study of numbers, data entry, data analytics, etc. I had worked in accounting for about six months, and wanted to move into location scouting and appraisal, which involved leaving the office and driving around different parts of New England for potential development projects. Margaret had promised to allow me to shadow her on a few of these trips soon for training, and it was my job to do my numerical work, and wait patiently for my first “scouting outing”.

I mention that the restrooms were directly across the hall from my cubicle, and I even got to become friends with the janitor, Jackson, who would come by in the afternoons to clean the restrooms, and even turned him onto to trying skittles from the vending machine, a first for him. As I was a keen watcher for desperation, I would often notice when the women would enter the restroom, though they were almost entirely composed, and never seemed in the slightest rush.

Except for a couple of instances, and rare as they were, they were all the sweeter for it. There was one afternoon when Margaret had taken Julie out with her for Julie’s first “scouting outing”. They had left the office at about 9:30 that morning, and at this point it was about 3:15 in the afternoon. I was just finishing a glass of water in the break room when I heard rushed and heavy female breathing entering the office, and stepped out of the break room just in time to see Julie walking with considerable haste down the narrow hallway space between the cubicles, Margaret trailing behind her at a much more relaxed pace before she turned into her office.

“How was the outing, Julie?” I asked her. Julie had been at the company for a couple of months longer than I had, looked like a young Melissa Joan Hart, and had always been friendly with me, especially when I had just been new to the office. She was slim and pretty, and had hooked up with a tall, handsome man from her hometown named, Brad, but had she been single, Julie definitely would have been my type. This day Julie wore a tight grey skirt that ended just above her knees, and a white top that had cute little fraying lace at the shoulders. She had blonde hair, and often beamed a big bright smile as she greeting people in the mornings, as her cubicle was closest to the entrance of the whole office. This particular afternoon, she wasn’t quite smiling when she turned back to address me, and actually appeared to be somewhat flustered and out of breath.

“Ugh! It was good until it was torture!” Julie said, with a laugh as she turned back to face me. I looked down, and Julie was subtly stepping between her feet as she stood facing me. I should have known that she was headed for the restroom as I was well aware that her cubicle was back in the direction of the entrance, but when I looked down and recognized all the telltale signs of a girl with a need to relieve herself, the stepping feet, the quivering and tensing thighs, the quick panicky breathing, the look of worry bleeding through the smile, what can I say? These are a few of my favorite things.

Part 2

“Torture?!” I asked, laughing with her. Julie brought her leg up in the air, bending her knee before stepping down and doing the same with the other leg, looking like she were on an invisible stairmaster, a classic pee dance.

Julie exhaled loudly, “I’ve had to pee for like two and a half hours now! I couldn’t use the bathroom at the property!” Julie exclaimed before continuing quickly to the restrooms. I followed behind her, headed towards my cubicle. Julie had a nice bubbly behind and she walked very quickly, with the obvious need to relieve herself.

“OH! No no no no no no.” Julie said before she started to walk in circles outside the restroom. The doorway to the women’s room had been proper open with a sign that read CAUTION: WET FLOOR: and Jackson was inside, mopping the tile floor of the small bathroom.

“Okay, okay, okay” Julie said as she paced in circles outside the closed women’s room. Julie forced a smile as I passed her and sat down in my cubicle chair, just feet away from her. From the angle at which I was seated, I could see Jackson through the propped open ladies room door, dutifully mopping the tiled floor.

When Julie realized my cubicle was just next to the restrooms and that I was witness to her desperate movements, she seemed to grow self-conscious and tried to drive down her dancing. She looked over to me, and seeming to feel a need to be polite, she forced a smile and asked, “How has your afternoon been here?”

“Oh you know, same old same old, just running numbers” but before I had even finished my sentence, Julie was turning back to peek into the restroom, stepping back and forth between her feet, Jackson still mopping, Julie turned back to me with a big sigh of frustration. She looked frantic, a young, pretty, but very distressed looking Melissa Joan Hart lookalike, frantic, frantic for a pee.

“Yeah, well we need the numbers people.” Julie said as she reached into the edges of the top of her skirt at her sides and slid her thumbs forward, bringing the waist of the skirt away from her rounded-looking abdomen, no doubt swollen from a full bladder. She breathed loudly, and could not stand still in place, try as she might.

“You alright Julie?” I asked.

Julie forced a smile and drove down her pee dance, “yes, I’m fine” her thighs still quivering in place. Just then, Jackson turned and saw me and stopped mopping as he greeted me with a big smile.

“Hey Alex, you save any of those skittles for me today?” Jackson asked with a jovial tone. Julie looked annoyed as she saw Jackson stop mopping.

“Not today man” I said. “I’ve switched over to the Lays potato chips! Change of season!” I said as I held up a new bag of Lays chips that I had on my desk. Jackson smiled and held open his hands in a “pass them over here” gesture. I tossed the bag of Lay’s chips across the hall into the ladies room where Jackson caught them, and at this friendly, distracted moment, Julie suddenly snapped at Jackson.

“Are you nearly done in there?” she asked, with noticeable annoyance in her tone.

“Yes I am ma’am, in just a couple of minutes, but this floor’s gonna take longer than that to dry. I might recommend that you go and come back in five minutes.” Jackson said, with a jovial, but matter-of-fact tone.

At a loss for words, Julie blushed and briskly stepped away without even saying anything to myself or to Jackson. Jackson smiled at me with a “what was that?” look. I shrugged as I got up and made my way to the men’s room, directly next door to Jackson’s mopping of the ladies room.

The door shut behind me and I walked past the sink and the single stall to the urinal, pulled my cock from my pants and began peeing into the great porcelain vessel. Suddenly I hear the door to the men’s room pushed open behind me, Julie rushing into the restroom, her hands reaching behind her back, and undoing the clasp of her skirt. Seeing me suddenly, she stopped and stepped from foot to foot, her heels clacking against the tiled floors loudly.

“Oh god, I’m sorry, I wouldn’t have come in if I knew it was occupied.” she said as she held up her loosened skirt, the waste clasp now undone. “I’ll wait outside”. she said as she reached behind her in an attempt to redo her skirt clasp. “Oooooooooh” she said with pain in her voice, still stepping from foot to foot, heels clacking loudly on the tiled floor as she brought the pressure back on her waist with the skirt clasp. I didn’t know what to say at all, but Julie paused before clasping her skirt, and let it loose again before she turned to me, blushing, before quickly looking away.

“I’m sorry, I just, I - I need to keep my skirt unclasped until I can relieve myself, and I- I just, I don't want to go back out there like this, oh god” (LOUD clacking of Julie’s heels on tile) “I - can I just wait right here? This is so embarrassing.” Julie said to me, panic in her voice.

“Yeah that’s okay, Julie, it’s not a big deal. You can use the men’s room if you need.” I said with empathy for the poor secretary.

“Okay,” Julie said, her eyes flicking between me and the empty stall just two feet behind where I stood. “I’ll just wait right here for you to finish” Julie said, continuing her pee dance in the men’s room. How peculiar, I thought to myself, here she is, this bubbly blonde little secretary with her skirt undone due to her swollen bladder, still feeling an odd need to be polite and wait for me to finish peeing at the urinal before allowing herself the chance to dive into the stall, yank up her skirt, pull down her panties and finally relieve herself.

Her breathing was quick and panicky, and the continuous clacking of her heels on the tiled flooring was awkwardly, obnoxiously loud, as she dutifully waited for me to finish urinating at the urinal. My stream was steady, and emitted a very quiet trickling sound as my piss found it’s way into the water at the drain. When my stream began to slow and hit the water directly, producing a MUCH louder splashing sound, Julie grabbed her crotch and squeezed hard with both hands as she bent forward and let out a guttural “Oh godddddd!”

“Julie, please, you don’t have to wait for me to finish, please pee” I said, motioning to the stall, genuinely feeling bad for the girl.

“Oh thank you thank you thank you!” Julie said as she rushed into the single stall. On the other side of the stall door, her frantic heel clacking continued as she struggled to get the lock fixed in the stall door. “UGHHHHH” Julie moaned as she struggled to get the mechanism in place. She finally got it and with lighting speed managed to tear down her panties (pink lacey panties around her high heeled ankles) and lifted up her skirt as she sat her bubble bottom on the toilet seat before unleashing a LOUD splashing stream directly into the toilet water. “OHHHHHHHHHH Oh god” I heard her utter, and as I was still peeing at the urinal, she seemed to grow self-conscious again and diverted her rushing stream to the porcelain on the sides of the bowl, quieting down on the splashing sounds. Her peeing still sounded HIGHLY pressurized, and her “Ohhhhh gooodddddddd”s accompanying her well earned relief sounded extremely sensual, and full of genuine relief.

Julie had clearly been dying to pee for ages. I finished at the urinal, washed my hands, dried them, through out the paper towels, all while Julie was still pissing and breathing noisily in the stall, just feet from where I stood. I was just about to exit the men’s room when I heard the toilet flush and turned to see a very sheepish looking Julie emerge.

“Oh god, that’s so much better” she said to me with a shy, meek, smile, blushing a rosy pink at the cheeks as she approached me at the sink to wash her hands.

“Sounded like you really needed it.” I said, not knowing quite how to respond to the whole situation, but picking up on Julie’s open, if abashed, broaching of the subject of her voluminous peeing.

“Ugh, you have no idea, I haven’t peed since before coffee this morning, and when Margaret went out to the property, which was more than 90 minutes away, nobody told me you aren’t supposed to use the commodes at these properties, and so I’m out there barely able to focus, but having to just hold it in the whole time, with Ms. Super Bladder Margaret telling me the whole time “oh it’s just part of the trade, get used to holding it!” Julie laughed as she said this.

“I guess I’ll know for next time, but I seriously needed to go this afternoon. Julie turned off the tap and retrieved paper towels from the dispenser as she dried her hands. “Go ahead of me, please. This is so embarrassing.” Julie uttered with another meek smile, asking me to exit the restroom ahead of her, feeling somehow like exiting alone would ease some of the “shame” of what she’d been forced to do.

With a “sure thing” and a subtle nod, I exited the men’s room and proceeded back to my desk, Julie exiting a few moments after me, nearly bumping into Jackson as he brought the mop bucket towards the men’s room. She awkwardly turned away from Jackson and rushed away, hoping not to be noticed by anyone else exiting the men’s room.

As I sat at my desk, I began to contemplate something that Julie had said when she referred to Margaret as “Ms. Super Bladder”. Thinking back, the moniker seemed quite accurate, Margaret always joined us for our morning coffee in the break room, and always emphasized proper hydration, but as my desk was located so near to the restroom, I couldn’t help but recognize that Margaret almost never seemed to use the restroom, save for only once at the very end of the day, and even then, she never appeared to be in any sort of a rush at all.

This could easily have been chalked up to the fact that she spent a lot of her days on outings at potential project locations, but if it were true as a rule of thumb that the agents form our company weren’t to use the facilities at these properties, that would seem to imply that Margaret would just “hold it” all day long, until just before leaving to go home at about 5 o'clock in the evening. Could this possibly be true? I looked up at the clock on my desk. 3:30, it read. Curiosity getting the better of me, I decided to go and pay Margaret a visit at her office. I had some documents to drop off to her anyway, so it only made sense to go and see her.

I grabbed a few spreadsheets that I owed Margaret and stood from my desk, walking over to the hallway. Margaret’s office was around the corner on the next aisle over, and as I turned into her office, I was met with the mesmerizing sight of Margaret’s delicious rear-end painted in her tight pink skirt as she bent over her desk looking over a map of some property or another. God, that woman had a beautiful butt.

“Thought I’d bring you these.” I said, as Margaret turned to me surprised at first, then happy to see the documents in hand.

Part 3

“Thanks, perfect, just what I needed.” she said. “And how are you holding up with all of these spreadsheets?” She asked me.

“It…you know, no problem at all, just numbers.” I said. Margaret stood perfectly casually by her desk, and showed no signs at all of needing the restroom, unlike poor Julie.

“Good, well, I’m going to take you on your first scout next week, if you think you’re ready for it.” she said to me with a big beaming smile.

“Can’t wait” I said, before proceeding from the room. I made my way back to my cubicle. “Ms. Super Bladder” is right I thought to myself. Margaret seemed entirely fine, and yet had had just as much coffee (and more water) as the rat of us in the break room that morning. What gives? I thought. Had she really just trained herself to “hold it” all day long and had just gotten used to doing this? I thought nothing more of it, until at about 4:55, just before the end of the day, I looked up to see Margaret’s pink-skirted butt walking into the ladies room as she pushed the door open, but again, not rushed looking at all, just a perfunctory visit to the restroom before the drive home, it seemed. Strong woman, I thought.

The rest of that week was fairly unremarkable. About the middle of the next week came, and Margaret enters my cubicle one morning at about 10 am.

“Knock knock” she says. Turning, I see that Margaret’s standing beside a slim young woman in about her mid 20s. “This is Elle, she’s from the New York division, and she’s actually gonna be trailing along for our scouting outing, today. Are you about ready to depart?” she asked.

“Hi” Elle said, extending a hand to me. “Elle.”

“I’m Alex” I said, taking Elle’s petite hand in my own.

We left a few minutes later, Margaret driving, and me politely allowing Elle the front passenger seat of the car. The whole drive out to the property, Elle was chipper and cheery as she gazed around at the the New England countryside, being a New York City girl, Elle was quick to explain to us that the countryside was an entirely different, and welcome world for her, this didn’t keep her from insisting that we stop at Starbuck’s so that she could get her favorite fall latte, and in good spirits, Margaret and I decided to indulge Elle and try one for ourselves.

It was a ninety minute drive by the time we were out there, and the countryside’s turning colors of fall were engrossingly gorgeous. Finally we pulled up to a long gravel driveway, which took us about a minute to Upon arrival, Julie began looking in all directions around the property, as she held her empty Starbuck’s drink.

“I suppose they’ll have a trashcan, inside.” Julie said.

“Well it’s likely…” Margaret said, eyeing Julie’s Starbuck’s cup. “but we won’t be going inside, today.”

“Oh no?” Elle said, looking confused.

“No, no, this is just a property run, we’re just looking at exterior dimensions, today. We won’t be touring the house. Just the outside.” Margaret said.

We began to tour the property. It was a vast estate, and we’d just begun to make our way along a well worn path covered in fallen leaves, the fences of the tennis courts covered in overgrown vines. The whole place was quite a pretty, autumnal scene. It took us nearly an hour just to scan the first perimeter of the property, Margaret pointing several things out to us along the way, myself taking mental notes, while Elle wrote things down in a small pad.

By the time we were nearly through touring the property, I’d noticed that Elle’s brow was furrowed and that she kept letting out muffled but frustrated sounding sighs, and her note-tkaing had become more abridged, more succinct. Whenever we would pause, Elle kept her thighs clung tightly together in her slim skirt. She seemed tense, and when Margaret finally anounced,

“Well! That’s it for us!” Elle let out a noticeable sigh of relief as she tucked her pad away in her purse. We made our way back to the car, and got in in the same seating arrangements. About forty minutes into the drive, Elle, had grown very quiet, and had taken to sitting with her legs crossed in the front seat, to uncrossing thems and holding them tightly together, but they were always constantly quivering with subtle, but alarming speed. She would let out long sighs and would lift her seatbelt from her abdomen from time to time as she wrong cross her legs tightly. She needed to pee, and I couldn’t blame her, for so did I. I’d been experiencing the effects of a growing bladder for the entirety of the tour too, and if I hadn’t been so distracted with Elle’s antics, I may have focused more on my own. I’d had the same amount of coffee as Elle and Margaret had, and when we passed an exit for a rest stop, Elle looked longingly out her window as she finally asked,

“Oooh, do you think we could stop at the next one? I’m sorry but that latte’s gone right through me, I could use a stop.” Elle said. Finally, I thought.

“Of course, no problem.” Margaret said. “I could actually use a stop, myself.”

“Ooh, this was new” I thought to myself. “Margaret never seems to need a “stop” until the very end fo the day near 5 o clock, but then again, we all had had an extra coffee drink in addition to our coffee back at the office earlier in the morning, and Margaret had also drank a large plastic thermos of water she carried with her as she took us around on the tour. It was logical that all of these liquids had finally caught up to Margaret.

Soon we hit a slow down in the traffic, the cars all halting to a crawl. This worried Elle.

“Ohhh, god, no, this is not happening.” She said as her legs began fanning in and out quickly. Her legs just kept moving as the car crawled forward.

“Oh but it sure is.” said Margaret, with resignation in her voice. Margaret let out a frustrated sigh, and peeking ahead, the traffic was thick and was moving quite slowly, no doubt the result of a car wreck somewhere up ahead in the road. Elle sighed loudly in frustration as she pulled the seatbelt away from her abdomen once again, the seatbelt making loud shushing noises as it was pulled in and out from it’s release valve. “huuuuhhhhhh” Elle said, letting out loud moaning noises as she frantically fanned her thighs in and out.

I also needed to pee pretty badly by this point, that coffee from earlier having caught up to em as well, and decided to move into the center seat in the back to keep a better eye on the traffic jam ahead, not acknowledging the fact that this gave me no power to change anything about our circumstances. As I moved into the middle seat, away from behind Margaret’s seat, Margaret’s own tight-skirted-thighs came into my line of sight. While not fanning in and out frantically like Elle’s, Margaret’s thighs were subtly, but constantly, bouncing up and down in her seat, her fingers constantly tapping the steering wheel in a speedy rhythm.

“Ughh, I really need the restroom. I really wish I’d known that there wouldn’t be facilities at the location.” Elle said with a quick, strained words.

Nonplussed, Margaret replied quickly,

“Well, it’s just part of the job. Sometimes we’re just there to survey the land.”

Elle sighed in frustration. “Well I guess I just didn’t realize there wouldn’t be restrooms, I’m sorry, this is my first day. Ughhhhhhh.” Elle’s thighs were fanning rapidly, making quiet clapping sounds when they would meet in the middle, and her skirt had ridden up her legs considerably now too, giving me a lovely view of her long, lithe thighs.

“Look, we’re going to stop as soon as we can, alright? Generally I don’t need the restroom til the end of the day-“ Margaret said, sounding uncertain as to how to handle the situation.

“Okay, and generally I don’t need to beg for the bathroom like a schoolgirl, either!” Elle snapped. She quickly covered her mouth with her hands. “God, I’m sorry, I really, I don’t mean to snap. I just- UGHH!!! I need to PEE SO BADLY! Ohhhhh god, I’m sorry.” and with this Elle sat up from her seat, and pulled up her skirt clear of her thin behind as she gripped frantically at her crotch with one hand while she held her seatbelt away from her swollen bladder with the other. She sat back down in her skirt, holding herself tightly now.

“You don’t have to be sorry.” Margaret said, her thighs bouncing very subtly. “It’s alright, you didn’t have any warning, but it was you who wanted those latte’s, if you’ll remember correctly.”

“Ughhhhh” Elle said, as she quickly picked up her empty latte cup from the upholder of the car, before dropping it back in. (Was she actually contemplating peeing in it? The world will never know.) She was still clutching her crotch tightly with her other hand, not daring to let go, her thighs slapping each other a little harder now.

The traffic before us was starting to move a little bit more now, and this seemed to give Elle some reassurance. She still held her crotch, but was a little less vocal with her moaning now. Instead, now she’d taken to breathing hard breaths through clenched teeth, sucking air in quickly through tightly pursed lips as she stared with worried concentration at the road ahead. She let out a long, strained whimper, sounding nearly like the cry of a distressed dog.

“Ughhh!” she moaned out loud as her hand quickly flung to the empty cup again.

“You guys, I’m sorry but I’m going to pee any minute- I- I need to pee in-“

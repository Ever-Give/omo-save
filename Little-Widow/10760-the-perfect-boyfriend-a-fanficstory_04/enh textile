How long do I need to wait? I feel like I am dying here. I love this story that much. I am a details person so I do notice that. I am sure you will have it work out. I cannot wait to see Kendall and Katie together and see why James is crying. He is such a sweet guy.

I'm hoping to have it up by this weekend or the beginning of next week. I'm half-way theeeerrree! xD Sorry. But yeah. :)

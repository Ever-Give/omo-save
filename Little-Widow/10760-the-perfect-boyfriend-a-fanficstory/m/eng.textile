*000*2012-12-13 18:05

So this is yet another fanfic I 'm writing about my favorite band. I'm in it, and I may combine the first few chapters just to get to the good parts, if y'all know what I mean. ;) Enjoy!

Chapter 1: Shy girl.

It was a somewhat normal day at casa de BTR: James was make goo-goo noises at his lucky comb, Logan was downloading five new books to his iphone, Carlos was eating his cereal in his helmet, and Kendall was just chilling, when there was a knock at the door.

"Hey Katy," Camille said happily.

"Hey Camille!" Everyone shouted.

"Guys, this is my cousin... Katie," Camille said awkwardly, staring at Kendall's little sister. "She's new to town and she's doing a piece on Hollywood's new and undiscovered talents for her journalism class. So I figured I'd let her hang out with you guys for today so she could do some interviews and stuff."

"That's cool," Kendall said. "We were going to head to the studio in a little while, so she can ride along."

"Sweet," Camille said. "Well, I have an audition at two, and then afterwards I'll come get you guys and we can hang out or something."

"Camille," Katie whispered. "Don't go. You know I'm not a people person."

"Oh don't worry," Camille said. "These guys wouldn't hurt a fly!" At that same moment, Carlos started swatting at a fly and made a huge mess of his cereal. "Except for maybe Carlos... Bye!" and Camille ran out the front door.

"So, you want to be a journalist?" Mrs. Knight asked. Katie nodded. "You don't say much do you?" Katie shook her head again. "So what time do you need to be at the studio?"

"Ten," Kendall shouted. He noticed Katie, and patted the spot next to him. "Come on. I don't bite." Katie quietly slipped into the seat next to him.

"So what's your name?" She asked softly.

"My name is Kendall. The guy making baby noises with his comb is James, The kid in the helmet is Carlos, and that guy with the computer is Logan. And we make up a group called-"

"Big Time Rush," Katie whispered.

"Guys! We gotta go!" Logan shouted. "Grab yo' gear and let's MOVE!"

"And I'm guessing we're running late by Logan's mood," Kendall added.

"Come on," Katy said. "You can sit up front so no one but my mom can bug you." And with that everyone ran out the door.

*001*2012-12-14 00:32

I'll hurry up and get to the good parts. feedback is more than welcome! I want to know how realistic and enjoyable this was.... let me know!

Episode 2: Sucky.

As they all piled into the elevator, Katie tried to melt into the background. of course, with six other people in the elevator with you and a gigantic book bag over your shoulder, that is kind of impossible. She tried to smile and answer the guys' questions, but she was still so quiet that they just sort of let her be by the time they were in the lobby. They all then piled into the van, which was felt incredibly small. Kendall ended up sitting in the very back in the middle, with Carlos on his right and James on his left. Katy was in the middle row with Logan, and Katie was riding shot gun with Mrs. Knight driving.

"So why are you so shy?" Mrs. Knight finally asked as they got on the highway.

"I've never been real good with words unless they were written," Katie answered. "Once I finally get to know someone it gets easier to talk to them, but until then... I'm a wall flower."

"I see," Mrs. Knight said. "I think spending some time around us might be good. What with Camille always gone and stuff. You're welcome at the apartment anytime."

"Thank you," Katie said. She slowly sank down into the seat while she listened to the chaos in the back seat, smiling to herself.

AT ROQCUE RECORDS...

"DOGS!!! YOU ARE LATE AGAIN!!!!" Gustavo shouted. "What is it going to take TO GET YOU TO- Who is that lovely girl behind you?"

"This is our new friend Katie, who is working on her journalism project," Kendall answered, nudging her forward. "She is a little shy, but-"

"NO BUTTS!!" Gustavo shouted. "YOU. Can work in my office on whatever it is you do! The rest of you, STUDIO! NOW!!!"

"Actually, I need to interview the boys and you," Katie said softly.

"Very well. Kelly! Get the dogs started on the track! You," Gustavo said, pointing at Katie, "will interview me in my office! Now move!" And everyone scattered.

###

"So how does it feel to know that you are helping a group of kids live their dream?" Katie asked Gustavo.

"See, as a person, who is constantly snubbed in the media, I am required to lie to you," Gustavo said. "So sure! It feels great to do what you just said!" Katie gritted her teeth and asked a few more questions, until she was fed up.

"Just send in Logan," she said.

...LOGAN'S INTERVIEW:

"Hi."

"Hi."

That was all that was known of that interview.

JAMES' INTERVIEW:

"So how does it feel to live the dream?" Katie asked.

"Yes."

"Okay... What is a big source of inspiration for you?"

"Yes."

"Is that all you can say?"

"We should make out sometime."

"I think we're done here. Be a doll and get Carlos for me, okay?"

CARLOS? CAN YOU MAKE HER BAD INTERVIEWS ANY BETTER?

"Probably not."

GREAT! THIS SHOULD BE FUNNY!

"So why do you wear the helmet?" Katie asked.

"you're pretty," He giggled. Katie broke her pencil.

LUNCH.

"Hey," Kendall said, poking his head inside Gustavo's office. "Kelly is going to get some food for her and Gustavo and wants to know if you want anything."

"Sure," Katie growled.

"The guys give you crappy interviews?" Kendall inquired.

"I have NOTHING!!" She shouted.

"Well maybe I can fix that," Kendall said, Grabbing her hands.

"Why are you holding my hands?" Katie asked.

"Kendall! What's the deal?!" Kelly shouted.

"I'd better go with her," Katie said. "I'll interview you when I get back, okay?"

"Deal," Kendall said. "Now go."

Episode 3: Oops.

James, Carlos, and Logan were enjoying their sandwiches when Kendall came over with a look on his face that screamed he was pissed off.

"She is trying to work her BUTT off for a good grade and all you three can do is hit on her?!" He shouted.

"She's hot," Logan said.

"Oh so just cuz she's hot that means you can't say anything?!"

"Yeah dude, you have to SAY something," James encouraged.

"ALL you said was yes!" Kendall shouted. He took a deep breath. "I am going to eat lunch, and then when she gets back, I am going to give her everything she needs for her paper or whatever."

"Yeah, about that," Gustavo interjected. "See, you all were too busy ogling over her, so I have CRAPPY BACK UP TRACKS AND YOU HAVE TO RE-RECORD THEM NOW!!!"

"Okay... Can we at least-"

"NO! STUDIO!!! NOW!!!!"

MEANWHILE AT SNAPPY SANDWICH...

"So THAT is how I ended up working for Gustavo," Kelly finished.

"WOW," Katie said, finishing up with a few furious scribbles in her notebook. "I... had no idea."

"Yep," Kelly said. "It just takes one drunk night in Vegas to get you hitched for life. But it does have it's perks. I honestly can't see myself with anyone else when it comes right down to it. We've been through so much together..."

"So do you LIKE working with Gustavo and the boys?" Katie asked.

"Totally!" Kelly said happily. "They're the first people in a long time to actually put up with his moods, and they're changing him. The whole situation is good."

"Order 15!" Someone at the register shouted.

"That's us," Katie said. "Come on."

WHEN THEY GOT BACK TO THE STUDIO.......

After Gustavo had eaten his sandwich, he calmed down some. He sent Kendall in to do his interview with Katie so that he could work on the song the rest of the day.

"So, you're sort of the whole reason you guys are in LA becoming rock stars. Can you enlighten me on that?" Katie asked.

"Well," Kendall started, "We were at home watching TV, when James saw a commercial for these auditions. We went, and Gustavo... Well, you know how he is. He turned him down, but offered me to come here and record some demos with him. I told him that I would only do it if my friends came with me. And that's how Big Time Rush started."

"Interesting," Katie said. "So... How do you like being a singer?"

"It has it's perks and pitfalls," Kendall said. "But one of the beast parts is being interviewed by you." Katie blushed.

"Are you trying to say something?" She asked.

"Maybe," He said. Suddenly the door flew open and Gustavo looked seriously pissed off.

"YOU! STUDIO!!! NOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!" He grabbed Kendall, dragged him out of the room, and slammed the door shut.

"Well thanks for that interview Kendall, I have so much more to use in my report," Katie said to herself.

IN THE BOOTH........

"Gustavo! I was in the middle of something!" Kendall argued.

"Well I'M on a deadline of 48 hours to get Griffen his next single, so WE have to WORK! Now SING!"

"Can I at least-"

"NO! SING!" Gustavo started the track. The guys started singing the track, but Kendall was on the end, about to burst from all the lemonade he had drank. As the song slowly required more breath, it got harder for Kendall to hold on. Finally, he just couldn't any more, and let go. Pee dripped down his jeans, as his breathing and harmonies came easier. Finally, when the song ended, everyone stared at Kendall, who was soaked.

*004*2012-12-14 22:52

Y'all are so sweet! :) And I kind of like putting two chapters in one update, because they are pretty short. So I'm just going to roll with it! :D

Episode 4: Totally.

It was quiet for a whole five minutes, until Gustavo finally broke the silence.

"WHAT THE HECK KENDALL????" He shouted.

"This is all YOUR fault!" He yelled, and he stomped out of the booth, hoping to get out of there without anyone noticing. He just forgot one little thing: Camille was coming by.

"Hey Kendall!" She said. He slowly turned around, his face beet red. "Um.... Dare I asks what happened?"

"What do you think?! Gustavo has been in a mood all day, he wouldn't let me leave, and I had too much lemonade and I pissed myself! And now, your cousin is never going to speak to me again!"

"That isn't true," Katie said from behind Camille. She opened her eyes to see both of them staring at her. "I think...... you look really really sexy right now. I would never stop talking to you. I wish you would talk to me more. I'm only quiet because I have never been good with words unless I wrote them, and I like you and you are just really REALLY turning me on right now."

"Um, thanks," Kendall said. "I like you too."

"Really?" Katie asked, looking up.

"Yeah. And if it helps you talk, we can talk whenever."

"Than how about this; Do you want to go out sometime?"

"Yeah," Kendall said. "Can we maybe start by going back to the apartment?"

"Sure," Katie giggled. Suddenly she saw James and Logan staring at her. "What?"

"That's like, the most I think you've said all day!" James shouted.

"I'm.... Leaving," Katie said, scurrying off.

"Nice!" Kendall shouted.

"Well it is," Logan said.

"Come on Camille," Kendall said, grabbing her arm. he towed her out to the car.

ON THE WAY TO THE PALMWOODS........

It was awkwardly silent most of the way home. As Camille pulled up to a red light, she finally broke the silence.

"Okay first off why are you so turned on by Kendall right now?" She demanded of her cousin.

"I don't know," Katie said. "I just... am."

"But... Nevermind," Camille said. The light turned green, and the car returned to the awkward silence the rest of the way home.

Episode 5: Awkwardness times 5,002.

Camille parked her car, and turned off the engine. No one made any moves to get out.

"Alright how are we going to do this?" Camille asked.

"The way I see it we have two options," Katie said. "We either form a conga line and walk in that way, or we form a line and DON'T break it."

"But you barely come above his waist," Camille said.

"I'm taller than that!" Katie argued.

"Look, we don't have a lot of options," Kendall said. "I vote we form a line, don't break it, and if that fails, just run for it. Does everyone understand that?" Katie and Camille nodded. "Than let's do this." They all stepped out of the car, formed the line, and started walking.

"Hey Kendall!" Guitar dude shouted. "Come on! We're all going to the pool!"

"Can't," Kendall said. "My sister needs me and then I have to go right back to the studio. Sorry!" And they picked up the pace to the elevator. They finally got in one, but the Jennifer's hopped on too.

"Sorry, but it's beauty time," Blonde Jennifer said. "Make room." Katie stepped back in front of Kendall, not wanting anyone but herself to know what had happened. "Who are YOU?"

"I'm Katie. I'm a blogger, and I have over 1,000 followers who hate blonde snobs," She taunted. "So be nice or I have to trash you."

"Ugh," Blonde Jennifer grunted. "Like YOU could do that to US."

"Oh, I can't?" Katie said as the elevator opened. "We'll see." And she, Kendall, and Camille all sauntered off the elevator.

"Thanks for that," Kendall said.

"No problem," Katie said softly.

"You two can do whatever, I'm going to the pool," Camille said. "Be home by five, or you have to cook dinner, understand?" Katie nodded.

"Well now that she's gone, when shall we go out?"

"How about tomorrow?" Katie suggested. "Camillle will be at home and we can.... Talk about all this."

"Okay then," Kendall said. "But I don't know that I can wait all that time to see you."

"No one said you couldn't see me BEFORE then," Katie pointed out.

"I'll text you," Kendall said.

"Then here is my number," Katie said, handing him a slip of paper. "See ya."

}}

Yeah, I know. I'll work on that for the next desperation scene.

{{:

This is an amazing story, although it would be a lot better if instead of saying "And he was soaked" you actually wrote a full description about what happened. That's what this site is for after all ^.^

}}

Oops! pressed the wrong quote! Yeah, I know it needs more desperation in it, But I'm still kind of shocked how easily it's accepted here. It's nice. :) I promise more of a build up in the next desperation scene though!

Okay, the next few chapters are pretty boring, but I promise you it will pay off in chapter 10 or 11 I think it is. :) And I PROMISE more desperation build up in that one too!

Episode 6: Fetish?!

THE FOLLOWING NIGHT........

"How do I look Camille?" Katie asked. she stood there in a strapless, asymmetrical dress with a floral pattern, hair straight, and make-up done.

"Like you just stepped off of southern belle runway," Camille muttered. "Now I am enforcing a curfew of 11 and you BETTER follow it. Your mom left me in charge and I intend to-" Suddenly there was a knock at the door.

"I'll get it," Camille said. Katie ran back to her room. "Hey Kendall."

"Hey," He said. "May I come in?"

"Sure," she said, stepping aside. "um, we need to talk."

"about..."

"As your friend, I am totally cool with you dating my cousin," Camille started. "But as her cousin, I am required to kill you if you hurt her and or if you don't get her home by eleven, okay?"

"Um, hi," Katie said. She was now wearing some strappy sandals.

"Hi beautiful," Kendall said. "you ready?"

"Um, yeah," Katie breathed.

"HOME. By eleven," Camille reminded both of them.

"Yeah yeah," the two of them said walking out the front door.

*.*

"So... can we talk about what you said yesterday?" Kendall said as he shoved a meatball around his plate.

"I guess," Katie said. "But it's probably going to freak you out."

"Please. I'm a man," Kendall joked.

"Alright," Katie said. she took a deep breath and started again. "I...Well... When I was really little, I, um, I peed myself a lot. As I got older, I grew out of it, but... I guess I started to miss it. And I was dealing with a lot of other things at the time, and I started... I guess masturbating."

"Hold up, you were masturbating at what age?!" Kendall demanded.

"eleven or twelve," Katie said softly. "At least I think I was. I... it just felt good. But as time went on, the facination... grew. I enjoyed pee more and more, but I had to be in the mood. and as I got older, the word 'fetish' started popping up as I looked for more... material. And at first I didn't want any of it, but I've come to terms with it, and I like it." She took a deep breath, and looked at Kendall.

"Wow," He said. "That's... interesting."

"You hate me," Katie sighed.

"No! No no no! It's just... a lot to take in at once is all. I like you! I really do."

"Really?" Katie asked.

"Really. And... I want to know more. I want to be a part of it. The fetish I mean."

"Are you... really really serious?" Katie asked happily.

"Completely, 100% serious," Kendall said. "But... I don't know how to."

"I'll teach you," Katie said, practically jumping out of her seat. "I'm sorry. I just... never thought that I would ever find someone who was willing to know ALL of me. I'm just really really happy."

Episode 7: Try.

"Thank you for tonight," Katie said as they walked into the Palmwoods. "I had a nice time."

"Me too," Kendall said. "So... what do we do now?"

"Well you can come over tomorrow and we can try," Katie said. "If you want to. Or you can just watch. It's going to take me a while to get used to having someone to get kinky with. But I do have just one little favor to ask."

"Shoot," Kendall said as they entered the elevator.

"Please please PLEASE don't tell ANYONE about any of this," Katie begged. "The last thing I need is to be a freak."

"No problem," Kendall said. "Discreet is my middle name. Well actually it's Francis, but no one needs to know."

"I like you," Katie giggled.

"Well here we are, apartment 4J," Kendall said. "Sleep well."

"You too," Katie giggled. "I'll text you tomorrow."

"I can't wait," Kendall said. "Bye."

"Bye," Katie said. She opened the door and walked inside.

THE NEXT MORNING.....

"Kendall!" Logan grumbled from under his pillow. "Answer your stupid phone!"

"Hello?" Kendall groaned into his phone.

"Kendall it's Kelly," she said. "Gustavo wants to set up a website slash blog for you guys and he wants your friend Katie to do it."

"For real?!" He shouted. Logan threw a pillow at his head. "Um, wait, why are you calling me?"

"Because she is way too vague in her blog and I need her number," Kelly said. "So do you have it?"

"Yeah, it's *CENSORED*," Kendall said.

"Thanks. Be at the studio by NINE," Kelly said, and she hung up.

WITH KATIE.......

"Hello?" Katie said.

"Hi Katie this Kelly."

*007*2012-12-20 17:52

I'm sorry about the boring elements, but trust me, it will all pay off once we get back to the omo parts. I promise.

Episode 8: OMG.

"Hello?" Katie said.

"Hi Katie this Kelly," she said. "I have a BIG opportunity for you. How would you like to work with gustavo and the boys to create their own blog on their own website?"

"Are you serious!?" Katie shouted. "I mean-"

"It's fine," Kelly said. "I'll see you at nine with the boys then?"

"Yes ma'am," Katie answered eagerly. Kelly hung up, and Katie dialed Kendall.

"Morning," He sighed.

"KELLY WANTS ME TO START A BLOG AND WEBSITE FOR YOU GUYS!!!" She squealed. "And I'm supposed to go with you this morning to the studio to start!!! Isn't this amazing?!"

"Aside from the fact that you just blew out my eardrum yes," Kendall joked.

"Ooops," Katie said, considerably softer. "Sorry. I'll be down after I get ready, okay?"

"See you then," Kendall said happily. "Hurry though, I'm making pancakes and they go fast."

"Save us! they're horrible!" Logan shouted with a mouthful.

"Bye," Katie giggled.

"What's all the screaming about?" Camille said, poking her head in.

"Gustavo wants me to create a website and blog for the guys!!" Katie squealed. "I have to get ready cuz Kelly wants me there with the guys this morning."

"That's awesome!" Camille squealed. "I have a callback, so I probably won't be home until like, six. Can you handle that?"

"Camille I have a REAL shot now, and you don't trust me to be home alone for a little while?!" Katie chided.

"Sorry," Camille said. "I just... don't want a rerun of what happened a few years ago is all."

"Camille I am not going to hurt myself again, I promise," Katie whined. "And besides, Kendall and I are gonna hang out after we finish at the studio this afternoon, so I won't be alone. Now if you will excuse me, I have to get ready for the biggest day of my entire life!"

"Alright," Camille said. "Break a leg!"

Episode 9: Interrogation.

"Hey Katie!" Kendall said as he opened the front door. "Come on in!"

"Thanks," Katie said. The apartment smelled like cinamon and chocolate this morning. "Smells good in here," she added.

"It ALWAYS smells like this in the morning when Kendall's happy," Logan mentioned. "It's like his good first date celebration."

"AND we get pancakes out of it," Carlos added, shoving another forkfull into his mouth.

"And I saved us some," Kendall said, motioning to the table. "I have to go get dressed, but help yourself."

"Thanks," Katie said, sliding into a chair. She grabbed two pancakes and placed them on her plate. James sat down next to her with his pretty-boy attitude going full force.

"So," He said, playing with a fork. "You seem to really make him happy."

"I guess," Katie said, cutting her pancake. "Kendall is really sweet."

"Well what does he have that I don't?" James demanded.

"Um, listening ears and he doesn't make out with a comb," Katie answered awkwardly.

"He made PANCAKES, which means if you break his heart, things will get very ugly," James warned.

"James, cool it!" Carlos shouted. "She's gonna be working with us for the next few weeks."

"Sorry about him," Logan said. "He's just a little crazy." James stomped off. "So you suddenly seem a lot more... social."

"I guess," Katie said, shoving another bite in to her mouth.

"So what changed?" he asked.

"I don't know," Katie said. "I guess I just... trust Kendall, and he trusts you, so I guess I'm cool with talking to you by association."

"That IS sound science," Logan admitted.

...AT THE STUDIO! :D

"Welcome to the Rocque Records family," Kelly said as soon as Katie walked through the front door. "Let me give you an official tour of the studio. The rest of you, get up to Gustavo." Katie followed Kelly over to the elevator.

"Thank you so much for this opportunity," Katie as soon as they were in the elevator. "This is a dream come true for me and I promise you won't regret your desicion."

Episode 10: How-to's.

"Alright, here we are," Kelly said when the elevator door opened. "Welcome to Rocque Records. If you can please follow me, I'll show you where everything is and where you'll be working." Katie trailed behind Kelly, taking as many pictures as possible for her personal blog.

"And you'll be working here in Studio B," Kelly said, motioning to the room. "If there is anything I can get you, please let me know. I've provided a few how-to books on website building and I've purchased the URL already." Kelly handed her a piece of paper with the web address on it. "I'll be back to check on you in a little while." And she walked off. Katie settled in to the chair and cracked open the "How to set up a website for dummies" book.

AT STUDIO A.....

"Sorry I'm late I was just settling Katie in," Kelly said as she walked in. "Where are we?"

"The dogs are stretching and preparing for X," Gustavo said softly. "Did you get the carpet cleaned from Monday's incident?"

"Yes," Kelly said. "And this time when the guys say 'can we' dot dot dot let them finish so we don't have to deal with something like that again. I'm surprised they aren't picking on him for it."

WITH BOYS.

"So what time are you and Katie splitting the studio?" Logan asked Kendall.

"We plan on leaving by about two thirty depending on Gustavo," Kendall said. "Why?"

"Camille won't be back by then," Logan reminded him.

"We were kind of planning on that," Kendall said, smiling to himself.

"Hold up, aren't you moving a little fast?"

"No, cuz it was her idea, and we aren't going THAT far... Just making out."

"Nice," Logan said.

AFTERNOON.....

"Hey beautiful," Kendall said as he sauntered into the room. "You ready to go?"

"Yeah, let me just check with Kelly," Katie said. "But before we go home and... try this, do you maybe want to stop by starbucks?"

"Sure," Kendall said. "I'll be waiting by the elevator."

SEVEN MINUTES LATER....

"Hey you!" Katie said as she skipped over to Kendall. "You ready?"

"Totally," Katie said. "To starbucks!"

*009*2012-12-22 19:17

And now for the long awaited return of the Omorashi part of this story! :D Sorry it took so long, but trust me, it's worth the wait. I did try to rewrite this chapter and make it a little more interesting. But I'm still sort of new at writing this stuff and not getting judged. :( But I promise, if you stick around, this story will satisfy. Especially when we get to chapter 26. ^_^ Oh, and this chapter is really long, so I'm only gonna post on this time. Enjoy!

Episode 11: First .

WHEN THEY REACHED KATIE AND CAMILLE'S APARTMENT......

"So... Is it normal to feel this... rebellious?" Kendall asked as Katie unlocked the front door.

"It does the first few times," she answered as she shoved the key into the keyhole. "And especially once you almost get caught. The feeling can be it's own kind of high."

"WHAT?! We could almost get-" Katie clamped her hand over Kendall's mouth at that point.

"You swore we would keep this a secret," She reminded him. "It's only happened like, twice. And besides, Camille has her callback, so she won't be home until dinner. We're completely safe. Trust me."

"I do," Kendall said. He wanted to make out with Katie so bad in that moment. Finally she unlocked the front door.

"After you," she said with a grin. They stepped inside the apartment and Katie unloaded her stuff from work that day. "Come with me." Kendall followed her into her room, and over to the computer.

"So we NEED the computer?" He asked, bouncing and grabbing at his crotch. He felt on the verge of another accident.

"Um, I like to watch videos to help, but sometimes it isn't necessary," Katie said. "Is the coffee helping?"

"Yeah, I'm nice and desperate," Kendall said, fidgeting quite a bit, but letting go of his crotch in case Katie happened to glance over at him.

"That should make things a little easier," Katie said as she opened an incognito window on Google Chrome. "Now take your shoes and socks off and just relax, and try to let go while you watch. Or masturbate. I don't care which," Katie said with a wink. She pulled up a video of two hot girls in a park, trying desperately to find a bathroom. But Kendall and Katie both knew their search was in vain. Kendall was clearly losing control, so Katie whispered to him, "Tell me how you feel. I want you to vocalize it."

"I.. Just... CAN'T!" He answered. He sank down on to the bed where Katie had set some towels.

"It's okay," Katie said soothingly. She started rubbing his shoulders. "I knew this might take some time. I didn't expect you to be so willing, but this stuff takes work, and time." Suddenly a wet spot started growing on Kendall's pants, but he clamped down on his crotch immediately to try and stem the flow. "See?"

"God, this feels SOO GOOD," He moaned. Katie took his hands off of his crotch, and kept rubbing his shoulders, growing even more attracted to him the more it grew. Suddenly it spread rapidly down his pants and made its way down onto the floor very loudly, making them both extremely aroused. Kendall kept moaning, when finally, the flow went to a trickle, and then stopped altogether.

"See?" Katie said. "You did it."

"I guess I did," Kendall said, blushing.

"Don't feel embarrassed," Katie said, kissing his head. "This is GOOD. You are so sexy right now." She squirmed a little herself.

"Your turn," Kendall said playfully.

"How shall I do it?" Katie answered.

"Jeans off, all over my legs," Kendall said, listening to his hormones. "NOW." Katie laid out some towels on the floor, and knelt over his already soaked jeans. She closed her eyes, and let go, Suddenly they were both moaning, not caring about anything other than each other at that moment. Eventually, Katie stopped, and she fell on top of Kendall, breathing just as heavy as he was.

"That was... amazing," Kendall panted.

"I know right?" Katie breathed. They laid there, listening to each other breathing, their heartbeats. Finally, they had to get up, because Camille would be home at any second. Kendall took his turn in the shower first while Katie went down to the basement to start the peed on stuff in the washer.

"Your turn," Kendall said, walking into the living room without his shirt. Katie looked over at him and smiled.

"You should were your shirt less often," She said. "I'll be right back." Kendall flopped down on the couch and turned on the TV. Camille walked in then.

"Hey Kendall," she said.

"Hey Camille," he answered. "How'd the callback go?"

"That's what I wanted to talk to you two about," Camille said. "Where's Katie?"

"She um, needed some uh..."

"I'm right here Camille," Katie said from behind the couch.

"Well, since you're both here... I GOT THE PART!!!!!"

"Oh my gosh Camille that's amazing!!" Katie squealed.

"I know!" She said. "But there's some new rules that have to go into effect now."

"Like what?" Katie asked.

"As of now, I may or may not be around 24/7," Camille said. "So... Kendall? Can you be the rock in this house?"

"Anything you need I'm there babe," he answered, looking up at Katie.

"Well then that's it," Camille said. "Oh, and I have a night shoot in two weeks, so we'll work that out when the time comes, okay?"

"Camille we will be fine," Katie assured her.

"Well as much as I would love to stick around and here about all of this, I am due back at home for dinner in about five minutes," Kendall said.

"Alright," Katie sighed. Camille took a hint and went to the kitchen to start on dinner.

"I had fun," Kendall said when they reached door. "Shall we... do it again tomorrow?"

"Totally," Katie said. She stretched up on her toes, and kissed Kendall. Things went on much like they did that day for the next two weeks, Kendall becoming more and more comfortable in the fetish with Katie. But then...

SATURDAY.

"You're up awful early," Katy said right as Kendall was about to sneak out the front door.

"I'm just going to see Katie," Kendall said.

"What is with you two? You spend like, ALL your time together and frankly, you're going broke doing laundry. Are you two-"

"NO!" Kendall said emphatically. "We're just... doing things. Now cover for me if anyone asks?"

"Always," Katy said. "Now shoo."

"Love you," Kendall said, and he planted a kiss on top of her head. He boogied out the front door and danced down to the elevator. He got all the way to Katie's apartment and knocked on the front door.

This chapter may gross the males who read this out, just warning you. And I love getting feedback, just FYI. Enjoy! :)

Episode 12: Period.

Kendall knocked on the front door.

"It's open," Katie Cried from the sofa. Kendall burst through the door.

"What's wrong?" he demanded.

"I started my period and I'm cramping," Katie groaned. "We can't do it today."

"What can I do to help?" Kendall asked, kneeling down next to her.

"Get me a glass of soy milk and the bottle of Advil out of the cabinet next to the fridge. And can you make me a grilled cheese sandwich with the olive spread in the fridge please?" Katie begged.

"Anything," Kendall said. "Stay here and don't move. I'll be right back with half of that." he kissed her forehead, and went to the kitchen to get the Advil and milk and came back over to the sofa. "here you go sweetie. I'll be right back with that sandwich." He kissed her forehead again and went back to the kitchen. Katie slowly got the advil in her and drank the milk. In that time Kendall came back with the sandwich.

"Here you go," He said. "Do you want more milk?"

"Yes please," Katie said softly. Kendall kissed her one more time, and left.

"So should I be worried?" Kendall asked.

"No, this is pretty much what happens every time," Katie breathed. "It just hasn't been this bad in a long time."

"Here," Kendall said, handing her the glass of milk. "Is there anything else I can do?"

"Stay here with me," Katie begged.

"Of course," Kendall said, kissing her again. "I'm not going anywhere."

"Good," Katie said. They spent the rest of the day watching The Twilight saga. Camille called them at about seven.

"Hey Camille," Katie said happily.

"You sound better," She said. "What changed?"

"Kendall came over this morning and he's been here all day," Katie said.

"About that," Camille said anxiously. "The moved the night shoot up to tonight."

Episode 13: Sleepover.

"About that," Camille said anxiously. "The moved the night shoot up to tonight."

"So? I can handle being alone in the apartment for one night," Katie said.

"You were doubled over in pain this morning when I left and you expect me to let you stay in the apartment alone tonight?!" Camille shouted.

"Well... What if I wasn't alone?" Katie suggested.

"Go on."

"Well, Kendall could stay with me. Granted he would have to sleep in your room or I would. But-" Kendall took the phone from her.

"We'll finish up with dinner here and go down to my apartment," he said.

"Thank you," Camille said. "Just make SURE she takes her medicine and has advil every four hours and if she gets PREGNANT-"

"Camille I'm flowing super heavy and that's what you're worried about?" Katie said. I should mention that Camille was on speaker phone.

"Good point," She said. "Just... Be careful, alright?"

"You too," Katie said. "The last thing I need is you coming home with a hickey or a broken arm or something."

"I love you and I'll be home at around nine. But then I'm gonna have to go to bed and-"

"Yeah yeah. I love you Camille," Katie said, and she hung up.

"Why is she so paranoid about leaving you alone?" Kendall asked.

"...She's afraid I won't eat or I'll try to hurt myself again," Katie said.

"You've tried before??" Kendall said, shocked.

"Yes," Katie said softly. "I was trying to deal with so many things and I just couldn't. So I took it out on myself."

Kendall took Katie's hands in his own. "Promise me you'll never ever ever do that again," He begged. "You're too perfect to damage yourself like that."

"I promise," Katie said. "So... I guess I should go pack a bag if I'm staying at your house tonight."

"I'll do it," Kendall said. "Wait here." And he kissed her on the forehead and left.

Episode 14: The twisty!

"Ready?" Kendall asked, carrying Katie's backpack.

"Always," Katie said flirtatiously. "oh wait a second. I need something from the kitchen." She hopped up and danced over to the kitchen. Kendall giggled.

"Am I amusing or something?" Katie inquired as she pulled her medicine case out of the cabinet.

"I just like to see you happy," Kendall sighed. Then he looked more carefully at what was in her hands. "What's that?"

"um, medicine," Katie said a she shoved the case in the closest available backpack pocket.

"for..?" Kendall added.

"Stuff!" Katie snapped, taking the bag. She took a deep breath. "sorry. I just... It's hard to explain."

Kendall took her hands. "Are you sick?" he asked, the seriousness clearly visible in his eyes.

"No," Katie whispered. "But the medicine... Helps make sure I don't relapse."

"Okay," Kendall whispered. "Do you have your house key?"

"yeah."

"Well lets go have a slumber party," Kendall said happier than before.

Episode 15: night!

"Katie!" Mrs Knight squealed when Kendall and Katie walked in. She hugged her. "How are you sweetheart?"

"Still kind of sore," Kendall said. "Um, Camille is shooting all night and doesn't want Katie home alone, so I wondered if she could stay here tonight?"

"Of course!" Mrs. Knight answered. "Come on in and make yourself right at home sweetheart!"

"Kay thanks mom!" Kendall said, pushing Katie into his room.

"What is she doing here?" Logan asked without looking up from his book.

"Camille is shooting tonight and doesn't want me home alone, and frankly she can't stand anyone sleeping in her room so Kendall brought me down here and I plan to stay the night," Katie said.

"Okay but there are rules," Logan said, closing the book. "NO SEX. And no making out! This room is a cootie free zone. Got it?" Katie and Kendall nodded. "Good. Now sleep."

"It isn't that simple," Katie started. "For one thing, it's only eight o'clock. And second, I need at least an hour to be able to fall asleep."

"God Camille has a weird cousin," Logan muttered to himself.

"And that cousin has ears and feelings!" Katie shouted.

AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER......

Katie was all snuggled into Kendall's chest, when he whispered to her, "What is the medicine for?"

"Depression mostly," Katie answered. "And emotional instability."

"So... you're mentally... disturbed?"

"Let's just say, you don't want me to miss a dose of those meds," Katie said. "Can we talk about this in the morning?"

"Yeah," Kendall said, smiling. He wrapped his arms around Katie, and she felt so safe and loved. This was truly the best moment of her life.

NINE THE NEXT MORNING.

"Camille, come in," Mrs. Knight said. "What brings you here?"

"Just came to pick up Katie," She answered.

"Well she and Kendall are still asleep. I can send her up when she wakes up if you'd like."

"Just tell her not to bug me until after two this afternoon please," Camille asked.

"Alright. Goodnight," Mrs. Knight said, and Camille left.

"Morning," Logan said as he danced out of the room. "Man, isn't today great?"

"Camille is sleeping all day," Mrs. Knight told him.

"Today SUCKS!" He said, and he stomped over to the couch and flipped open his book.

IN KENDALL'S ROOM.......

"So... THAT'S the reason you need them?" Kendall asked Katie.

"Yes," She said in a small voice. "And I... I feel so..."

"Don't be embarrassed," Kendall said, caressing Katie's cheeks. "I think as a person who loves you and wants to take care of you or should anything happen that Camille wasn't around, I need to know that. I'm glad you told me."

"And it stays between us, right?"

"Unless someone else absolutely has to know," Kendall said. "So how's the cramps?"

"Not as bad this morning," Katie answered. "I still need to take some advil though..."

"Shall I make pancakes?"

"Of course!" Katie said.

So, I know everyone likes my omorashi stories and the clothes the girls wet in, but now I have a question for everyone else. What kind of clothes should the girls in my next couple of stories wear? I already have the characters thought up, all you have to do is pick the clothes you love to watch girls wet in the most. I'll always accept requests as I love hearing from my fans, so start requesting! And I'm extremly good at discribing clothes, so don't shy away from the details! :D

I'm a big fan of ballet outfits. I'd love to read a story involving a girl getting desperate and wetting something like that. :)

Yeah, one features a shy and quiet girl at her friend's slumber party and she has to ppe pretty badly but is too scared to get up and use the bathroom. I don't have any daring ones yet but if you want me to add some then I will be glad to. :)

How funny, the shy girl is alos smart, I was actually going to put her and her friends in pjaiamas, but if you want me to, I could either do one of her friends dressed like that or the daring one in my next attempt. :)

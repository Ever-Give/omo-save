Oh, please, don´t get me wrong! I didn´t want to dig more into any of your other experiences!

I just expressed a totally hypothetical fantasy about the incident you described here - being a desperation lover, my fantasy of course went into a certain direction, but nothing that should make you feel embarrassed - I was just playing with fantasies, as we all do here... ;-)

Oh, I'm aware of that lol. I was just saying that there was one time in school when I was like ten times more desperate to pee.

Part 3

Stepping out of the shower, bathroom full of steam, Roxy found a note next to the sink about a hairbrush and what to do with it. It didn't take long for her to get it figured out, and oh boy her hair was beautiful! If anyone wanted to advertise curly hair, they'd have to see Roxy's mesmerizing multi-colored straight hair first!

After getting dressed, this time in black shorts and a pink shirt, she opened the bathroom door and the steam spilled out into the hallway. Evidently, the pets had also been worried about Roxy. They both sat at the doorway, Sasquatch not really giving an expression, but Nala was panting with her tail going crazy! Roxy took a moment to stroke Nala's fur, and went to scratch behind her ears when she noticed the band around her neck. Again, Roxy had been reminded of her time at the farm. But for some reason, this time it didn't seem to bother her as much. Had being here surrounded by caring people helped her to process what had happened? It sure seemed like it.

With her newfound confidence, Roxy followed her nose to the kitchen where the boys were working on breakfast. The table was already set, with Damien sat in one chair and Travis doing the cooking. As always, Roxy's nose twitched in response to the smells of a meal being cooked up. So cute!

"Morning sleepyhead. You feeling okay today?" Asked a nonchalant Damien.

"Yeah, I'm okay. Shower was nice." Responded Roxy, not wanting to divulge what had happened in the shower.

"While you were asleep, Damien and I were talking about our plans for today. There's a storm coming later this morning. We'll have to wait until it passes before we visit the woods and look for your parents." Said Damien, checking his phone and confirming the thunderstorm to be only 25 minutes away.

"Awesome! When the air is moist after a nice rain, I can follow scents for miles! Sounds like it'll be a good day to go exploring!" Said Roxy, her tail swirling and ears twitching in response to this news. She had a rather hopeful look in her eyes this morning, and the two young men intended to keep it that way.

"Last night, you started to tell us something about where you used to live. I get that it's hard for you to talk about, so I'll go first" Said Travis, shifting the tone of conversation. "I used to be homeless. I never knew either of my parents. The hospital told me that they just left, and then nobody could find them again. I grew up in an orphanage. There was never enough food for all of us, and they couldn't keep enough people there to take care of us. Eventually, I ran away. I found myself homeless, at the age of 16. An older man took me under his wing, teaching me how to make it in the wintery conditions. Forced to beg and steal, we didn't project a very good image. Most people didn't give us kind looks, others just kept going. Eventually, a man came through and donated food and clothes to our little camp under a bridge. He dropped his wallet on his way out, and I returned it to him. Nicest guy I've ever-"

Damien interrupted. "Yeah. I thought for sure you'd just pocket the damn thing haha... It was refreshing to have it returned. That's when I took a liking to Travis here. I was the one that made the donation and dropped my wallet on my way back. A few days later, I checked back and found that the old man had left him there. Just took all the money I gave the two of them and disappeared. Travis didn't have a chance to get any of it, or the clothes. That's when I made the decision to bring him home with me. He was a citizen, so getting him cleaned up wasn't hard. His homeless past made finding jobs hard... Luckily he's a very kind and helping guy. One day, he started helping out at a gym. A few hours later, he was offered a job there. Two years later, he was managing the place. He still manages that gym. He has everyone's respect and has the place running like clockwork."

Continuing on with his story of how he and Travis got here... "I grew up in a small town. My family was rich, and as such, I didn't have too much to worry about. I realized pretty quickly that I was good with machines and cars. It didn't take long for me to start working at a local garage for extra money while I was still in school. I eventually made enough to buy a house and I left. My parents never really paid attention to me. It was like I wasn't even there. We had money, and I had access to it, so it's not like I didn't get food or anything... It just felt empty... This is the house I bought. A two story with a finished basement and 4 car garage near the edge of the city. The whole encounter with Travis happened about two years after I moved here. And that's how we got here. If you'd like to share anything, I'm all ears. You don't have to if you don't feel like it."

Roxy decided it was time to get some of this off her chest. Yes, it bothered her, but it was time to do something about that. "I grew up in the woods. My mom left when I was real young and all I remember of her is her scent. I can't even picture her anymore. My dad was human. A short man with some sort of illness called cancer... He never really told me much about it. Not that I really got it anyways... There would be days he'd be 'sick'... At first I thought he was just messing around, but it became obvious that sometimes he just didn't have much strength... Things got worse and worse until a group of people showed up and separated us.

I was taken to a farm, thrown in the basement, and kept there for a few years. I was only given food and water... Nobody seemed to care about me... All they knew was my name, Roxy. They put it on a band around my neck and forced me to stay in the basement. Finally, enough was enough. One day, the parents had left to go to a nearby farm and help out with the animals. I made a break for it. Several teenagers tried to stop me. Each got claws to the forearms and wrists, and I made my escape. I went back to the hut where my dad had always lived, but he wasn't there. I never saw or smelled him again."

"Roxy... I hate to say this, but you dad probably didn't make it. All alone in the woods with cancer... That's too much for anyone to handle." Damien said, trying to pick his words in a way that didn't sound like he thought her dad had abandoned her.

"Every now and then, I would pick up a whiff of my mom's scent, but I could never find her. I tried to find her for years, only to end up alone in the woods for years. I have no idea what else I was supposed to do."

"Look. You didn't do anything wrong. Someone else did something wrong to you. What's important right now is cheering up. We'll try to find your mom. As for your dad, the police probably know that one. We'll need to get your fingerprint taken, and then they'll see if they can find out who your dad was." Said Damien, trying to keep Roxy's spirits up.

"Hey now, enough of the gloomy chat. Breakfast is ready!" Travis said this as he started putting breakfast sausage, home fries, and orange juice in front of Roxy and Damien at the table. He then took his own seat and the trio began their breakfast.

Just like the previous night, the food was heavenly! A gentle purr could be heard from Roxy between bites! It was enough to melt a man's heart! Damien and Travis would have to do everything they could to keep her happy, it was the best way for them to keep these moments coming.

BOOM! A lighting strike just down the road! Roxy's ears stood up and shook in place, before flopping half over again. She resumed breakfast as if nothing had happened.

"Wow. I thought for sure you'd be terrified of storms. I've never met a single cat that isn't." Said Travis, with Damien nodding in agreement.

"I'm not a cat! Those things can't talk English or even stand up for more than just a moment."

"Sorry, didn't mean it that way... But you do have to admit, you sure have some features that look an awful lot like a cat. Your ears, nose, and tail for example. And the colors of your hair."

"Yeah, I guess so..." Roxy twirled her hair between her fingers, noticing how much it seemed to resemble certain portions of Sasquatch's calico fur.

Having finished breakfast, the duo showed Roxy through cleaning the dishes and stacking them to dry. As always, she was amazed by the simplest things. The scents of breakfast had been nearly completely removed from the plates and silverware. The pan however, that proved more difficult. She could've swore she cleaned it four times before the smell of sausage went away.

"Wow. I guess we don't have to worry about poorly cleaned dishes with you here. I never thought even considered using smell to check is something was clean. I've always just looked at it and been like, yep, that's clean." Said Damien, his eyes fixed on Roxy's twitching nose.

"Since there's nothing better to do during a storm, you wanna help me out in the garage Damien?"

"Sure thing man. After all, I did tell you we'd do this yesterday."

"What's the plan now?" Asked a curious Roxy.

"I bought a car a few days ago, but it needs a lot of work. Damien said it wouldn't be safe to drive until we put new brakes on it. That's the part that makes it stop." Said Travis, trying to explain in a way that Roxy would understand.

"Can I watch? I don't see what else there is to do right about now either." Asked Roxy, trying to take the opportunity to learn as much as she could about what people do in the city.

"Sure. But first, have yourself a taste of this." Damien said, handing Roxy a tall glass of milk.

After loving the first sip, Roxy downed the whole glass. It was delicious! She was licking her lips for several minutes after that one!

The two young men again took a moment to take in just how cute Roxy was when she was enjoying herself. It was a sight to behold!

With the glass washed and set on the drying rack, the trio made their way to the garage. Luckily, it was attached to the house and they didn't have to walk through the rain.

Travis had bought the brakes from the auto parts store down the road while Damien was out finding Roxy, so they already had the parts they needed, or so they thought. Turns out that Roxy had something else to show them.

Neither Damien or Travis could get the lug nuts to turn. They'd have to get the front wheels off to get to the brakes, but the nuts just wouldn't move.

To the surprise of both young men, Roxy asked if she could try. Damien placed the lug wrench on the nut, and instructed Roxy that it needed turned to the left. Roxy bent her legs and elbows, before heaving up with her right arm and down with her left. A lout metallic crack could be heard, and the whole car moved slightly. Roxy immediately jumped back, dropping the wrench as she did so. Feeling she had done something wrong, she looked to Damien with fear in her eyes.

She was met with a confused stare. "Simply amazing. I had no idea you were this strong! Look, you got it to turn!"

Roxy took a look at the wheel, and confirmed what Damien had said. The nut she had attempted to loosen had in fact moved.

"Think you can do that to the others?" Asked Damien, trying to get Roxy to find something to do with all this energy she always had.

Having been showed to the wheel on the other side of the car, Roxy broke free all the nuts on the front wheels.

"Okay. Now's the part where I need to ask you to stand back." Damien and Travis began positioning floor jacks under the car, and once both were confirmed to be in position, they started pumping. The front of the car came right off the ground.

The rest of the job was quick and easy work. It was just brakes, after all.

Roxy watched the entire job intently. It was super cool. She's never seen one of these taken apart before. She memorized how one side went together, and asked if she could help with the other side.

Damien was forced to speak up in objection to this. "I'd rather you not. Brakes are important, without them there'd be no way to stop the car. We need to make sure this is done right. Maybe next time."

With the brakes completed, the duo put the wheels back on and tightened the lug nuts back down. Roxy was once again asked to stand back before the car was lowered back onto the ground. All that was left was cleanup, which went without issue.

With the trio done with Travis' car, they went back in for a drink. Noticing that it was no longer raining, the decision was made to head to the woods to try to find Roxy's mother.

They brought Nala with them, and the decision was made to start where Damien had first found Roxy.

It didn't take but a moment for the two young men to notice just how at home Roxy was in the woods. The way she stood with her knees and back slightly bent meant that she could immediately react to uneven terrain or a rock/stick moving underfoot. Nala took a few minutes to sniff everything, before coming back to the trio. Roxy had started moving in a sort of spiral. She would go in circles, pausing to check for a new scent, then make a bigger circle, and repeat. Suddenly, her ears and tail did their happy dance again! She'd found it! Her mother's scent!

Roxy followed her nose for almost half a mile before she lost the scent. That's when she saw it. Nala wasn't far behind her, probably following the same scent! Nala didn't stop with Roxy, she kept going. With the trio in tow, Nala laid down a course to the edge of the forest and across a meadow. Entering a different forest, Nala kept going. It was only a few feet before Roxy picked up on the scent again! This was going perfectly!

After about an hour of following smells, the group could see a mansion in the distance. It was all alone. No driveway, no cars. The trio stopped, seeing that a gardener had seen them and was walking their way. Once they were about 50 feet away, they started saying something the group couldn't understand. It sounded like baby talk.

"Rowwwwweelllll, Mowwwelllllll, Reow!" Was all that Roxy said before the gardener dropped their spade and came running! It seemed like it was too good to be true. This wasn't Roxy's mother, but it was someone who lived at a mansion that had her mother's scent all over the lawn. And they'd apparently recognized Roxy!

Roxy ran to them, meeting them halfway. The two did a little circle, taking in each others' scents. The gardener appeared human, but it was obvious that they possessed a similar sense of smell to Roxy. Not to mention the green eyes with upright pupils. Only the ears and tail were missing.

Damien put Nala back on her leash and the two young men made their way over to Roxy and the gardener with Nala in tow. Introducing themselves to the gardener, the duo asked if they knew Roxy.

"I've heard about her, never thought I'd get to meet her though. She disappeared when she was only a cub, her father disappeared at the same time. We never found them, although sometimes her mom said she could pick up on Roxy's scent in the woods on the other side of the meadow. She never did find her baby Roxy. It didn't help that her sense of smell only got worse as she got older."

Damien took the moment to speak up. "You hear that Roxy! They thought you were gone, just like we thought your dad was gone. Maybe there's still hope for finding your dad."

"I don't know where he would be though. There's no trace of his scent." Roxy answered, checking again for any new scents.

"You mean Scott? The only human to ever find this place? He just took you when you were just a baby. We never saw him again. Hmmm... Guess we need to change that to the only human to ever find this place without one of us to show him the way. Either way, I'm just glad you're still alive. Your mother's gonna be so excited to see you!"

"Speaking of my mother, how has she been? I honestly can't even remember what she looks like. I just know her scent, and the sound of her voice."

"She hasn't had the spunk she had back when she had all her kids. She has issues with her hips, and she can't get around on all fours like she used to. She just walks everywhere upright now. She's had days where she struggled to get out of bed, but it usually get better once she's moving for the day. Once you went missing, Daisy and Stella wouldn't so much as leave the house, and your mom lost any opportunity to go romping around the forest without having to leave her kids behind. Even now, they refuse to go out into the woods. C'mon, let's go say hi! I'm sure you're excited to see her too!"

The gardener began leading the group towards the mansion. It was a long walk, considering the size of the lawn they'd have to cross. This gave them time to talk about things that both sides were curious about.

"Does Roxy's mom not have a name? Even you just keep saying your mom or their mom."

"Yes of course she has a name. It's ������������"

"I didn't get that at all, did you get anything Damien?"

"Nope. Nothing at all man."

"That's because it can't be pronounced by humans. Her father was the first of his kind, deciding to name his daughter in the feline language he loved so much. It was his daughter, Roxy's mother, who decided to start using more human names so that they could eventually meet humans and get along with them. As you can tell, that's not what happened with Roxy here."

"What do you mean? Damien and Travis are my friends! Their dog here helped me follow ������������'s scent, which led me to this place."

"Wait, these are humans? I thought they'd just lost their animalization like I have."

"I assure you that my buddy here and I are both human. We live in the city to the east." Said Damien.

"Interesting. Then this animalization is what lets Roxy understand our pet dog and cat? She had entire conversations with them last night." Said Travis, curious about so many things at the moment.

"Yes. In short, animalized people possess the abilities and traits of many animals. It was Roxy's mom who was born purely feline, not a mix of all wild animals, and decided to raise her own children instead of adopting from the main family. That's why this place is so secluded. The main family cut us off many years ago. Having horse, ox, bear, and many other powerful beasts in their blood, they moved out entire mansion out here and left us here. Roxy's grandfather is the only one here who has the main family's blood in him. I don't know how he did it, but he fought off every single one of them to keep us safe. That's when the agreement was made to forbid us from coming back, rather than starting a war with us. Besides, none of us could hold a candle to what any of the main family could do. We don't have the instinct, the strength or the speed. There was simply no other way."

"You're kidding. If you're all as strong as Roxy here, how could you not have defended yourselves? When she runs on all fours, she can leap from the base of a tree and land over 200 feet away, continuing her sprint at ungodly speed. She crossed the entire forest in less than two minutes!"

"HUUUHHH?! You can do that?!" The gardener spoke with utter shock in her voice. "But you're only feline?"

"So what? I can speak feline, canine, bear, deer, and English. Although bear was more of something I was pretty much forced to learn. Meanies kept getting into arguments with me about territory."

"That's absurd! You're only feline! How do I know you're not lying to me?"

"Does it mean something that I can do these things? I've always just done them."

"Show me. I honestly can't believe that you'd be able to do it. Just straight up, as high as you can."

"Guess it's the only way you're gonna believe me... Moron..." The last part being only muttered.

Having said she'd make them believe her, Roxy squatted down to the ground. The had her back bend almost in half, knees directly under her neck, and her feet were only on their toes. She let out something between a growl and a grunt when she sprung up off the ground. In one quick motion, she was just gone. The group was knocked back a step or two, noticing two oddly foot-shaped indents in the lawn where Roxy was. They looked everywhere, but simply couldn't find her. She was nowhere to be found. The group just looked at each other, making sure that had actually just happened.

A distant voice caught their attention... "Heeeeeyyyyyy!!! I'm up here you dummies!!!" The voice was coming from on top of the mansion! Over 300 feet away and over 100 feet up! Either way, it was definitely her voice.

She jumped again, this time missing the group and landing about 30 feet beside them. Landing on all fours, one of her wrists buckled and she tumbled over a couple times. Luckily, she didn't look hurt. She stood up, stretching her wrists and back.

"I don't know why that keeps happening. I get all four under me, then I just topple over. That's why I usually keep running when I land." Roxy said this with embarrassment on her face and her hand stroking the back of her head.

"That's not what we're amazed with. I've never seen anyone do that. Not even your grandfather." Said the gardener, now more convinced than ever that Roxy was a true miracle.

Damien and Travis looked to each other, their minds in sync. She can do all that, yet she still manages to wet herself on a daily basis."

The group continued their walk to the front door. The gardener rang the doorbell, and the door was answered by a shorter version of Roxy! The two locked eyes immediately, their ears, tails and noses going!

"Chloe, who's this?" Asked the younger version of Roxy.

"I'll tell you later Stella. Could you please get your mother and have her come meet her guests?"

"Of course! Be right back!" Exclaimed Stella, running back into the house and up the stairs.

Roxy's thoughts got all mixed up. Was Stella just walking fast? No, she was definitely putting effort into that slow run. Her arms were shooting forward and backward at her sides and everything. She even took the time to climb the stairs, before getting to the top and continuing her previous run... Did she not know she could just jump the staircase? Surely she'd have tried that at some point. Either way, she smelled just like Roxy. She surely wasn't limited to what a human could do. Humans don't smell anything like that. The whole family smelled similar to Roxy. Not even close to the scent of a human.

After being lost in thought for a moment, Roxy snapped back to her senses. She was here. This was it. Her mom was coming to see her! Next thing you know, a figure appeared at the top of the staircase. It was an older lady, slightly hunched over with a bit of an awkward walk. Stella and Daisy came running down the stairs on either side of the old lady, both arriving at the door at the same time. Both still filled with amazement, Daisy only had one thing to say.

"Hi, I'm Daisy. It's nice to meet you! What's your name?" Asked the other younger version of Roxy, who had also ran down the stairs at a human's pace instead of simply jumping to the bottom.

Roxy took a moment to process all this before giving an answer. "It's nice to meet you, I'm R-"

"Roxella? Could that possibly be you?" A voice came from the bottom of the staircase. The old lady still making her way to the front door, now with a new spring in her step.

"Uh... Roxy..." She said back.

"Roxy... Could it be... Come here, let me give you a sniff."

Roxy stepped towards the old lady. Even with all these scents mixed together, it was obvious. This was her mother! She was just so excited she could barely stand still!

The old lady took a sniff of the area at the top of Roxy's neck. "No doubt about it. You're Roxella. My little miracle!"

Roxy's ears again twitched, her nose picking up on a new scent. Who now? They didn't smell like any of her family, and they didn't smell human either. Something more... A mixture... That's it! The master of the house, had to be! The gardener had said the man was every beast in one.

A booming voice came from inside the mansion. "WHO LET HUMANS IN HERE?! YOU KNOW THEY'LL HUNT YOU!"

"Uh... We're not here to hunt anyone... We brought Roxy back. I found her in the woods, and she didn't have anywhere to go so I took her to my place and got her cleaned up. She has some of my clothes too. Just today, our dog helped her follow a scent to this place. Believe me, we're not here to cause trouble. We just wanted to see Roxy returned." Said Damien, his voice all over the place as he was struck with fear from the booming voice within. Whoever this was, even his voice sounded like some sort of master of all the beasts in the forest.

"My name's Travis, this here is Damien. Like he said, we were just helping Roxy follow her mother's scent." Travis also delivered this line with fear in his voice, although he was not physically shaking like Damien was.

"I can smell you up here. At least do something about your scent." The voice said.

"Okay... What should we do?"

"Go roll in the grass or something, I don't know!"

Knowing it would be bad news to get on this man's bad side, the duo left the porch and rolled in the grass for a moment.

"Much better. You still smell like humans, but at least the pungent odor is gone."

Roxy's mom was next to speak up. "Dad, do you really think we should be doing this in front of the kids?"

"Yeah, good point. Daisy, Stella, go play in the lawn while the grown-ups talk for a bit."

"Sorry about him. English isn't his strong suit. He is from the main family after all." Said Roxy's mother, her eyes locked on Roxy.

Roxy decided to speak up about her earlier thoughts... "Hey uhh... Are Daisy and Stella my sisters or something?"

"Yes. All three of you are my daughters. To be honest, I'd thought I only had two daughters for awhile now. I lost track of you years ago."

"Yeah, same here. I could catch a whiff of you from time to time, but your scent always just stopped at the edge of the forest."

"Yeah, the meadow does that. That's where dad fought off the main family. There's so many scents mixed together on that damn meadow, even I can still smell it. No way to follow a trail through there."

Travis felt the need to voice a curiosity. "Do you think Nala here was able to follow your trail because she's not familiar with the scent of this main family? After all, the meadow didn't even slow her down."

"No. That's just because she's a hunting dog. Following scents is what they do best."

Next up was Roxy's turn to voice her curiosities. "I have to say, I'm rather confused with everything that's going on. Why do Daisy and Stella run like that? And Stella knew to get you quickly, yet she still took the time to run up the stairs instead of just jumping over them."

"Huh? Because they're feline. None of us can do what your grandfather up there can. Speaking of which. Dad, come down here! It's rude to not great guests!"

"Well, I don't know what he can do, but I can do this just fine..." Roxy raised her voice an order of magnitude. "Daisy, Stella, run to the far edge of the lawn!"

They did exactly this, running like humans and running out of breath by the time they got to the end of the lawn. Next up, Roxy took off. She leaped to the side, jumping onto the decorate boulders on the side of the porch. From there, she leaped into the air, making it more than halfway across the lawn before landing on all fours and sprinting to Daisy and Stella. She had done all that in just under ten seconds! Her sisters had taken over two minutes to make it the same distance, but Roxy wasn't done. She went right past her sisters and leapt onto the top of one of the trees at the edge of the forest.

Everyone just stared. Daisy and Stella looked straight up, and there she was, in the top of the tree! It was as if it all happened in fast forward!

The tree still swaying from Roxy's speedy landing, she yelled down to her sisters. "You mean to tell me you two can't do that?"

"That was amazing! Of course we can't do that! What do you think we are, wild beasts?"

"Well I can do it, so why is it that I'm the only one? Tell me you can at least jump."

"Of course we can jump! Just watch!"

The two sisters tried their best, but they only got about thirty feet off the ground, and both landed on only their feet before Daisy toppled over.

"Well at least one of you lands better than I do hahahaha"... Roxy shifted her tone to be less commanding. "You're both too stiff, you jumped like humans. Here, this is how you do it." Roxy let go of the tree, landing on all fours and again toppling over. She showed her sisters how she positioned herself for a long jump. Her whole body was so contorted it just wanted to spring back to being straight, and she let it do exactly that, sending her nearly 400 feet into the air! From that height, it took a moment for her to come back down. When she did, she landed with a thud. Not a very graceful landing, resulting in her toppling over yet again.

Stella and Daisy were just looking at each other. Why hadn't they tried that. They decided to give it a shot. They both gave it their all, but neither could get their legs or their back to bend like that.

"You've gotta curl your tail around your legs. It's the only way you'll get your back to arch far enough." Said Roxy, trying to find out if she truly was the only one that could run and jump like that.

"What? Where'd you get the idea that we have tails?"

"You're kidding. You don't have tails?" Roxy came closer, and Daisy was proven right. No tails. Huh... "Well you do at least have the ears, so at least you're not completely human."

"You mean these?" Said Stella, removing a headband with a pair of ears on it.

"Let me guess. You don't have claws either."

"No, but we keep out nails sharpened so we can climb the trees in the yard easier."

"Huh. If we're sisters, then what happened? This just doesn't seem right."

Stella spoke up. "You're telling me your ears and tail are real? Let me see that!" She reached for Roxy's fluffy ears, but they just folded down out of the way. "And you can move that tail? It's not just a belt with a tail on it?" Roxy again flexed her tail back and forth, before using it to tickle Stella's nose.

"And... You have real claws? SHOW ME SHOW ME!!!" Exclaimed Daisy, her eyes full of curiosity! Roxy flexed her fingers, and out popped a full set of claws.

"Unfortunately, I don't have claws on my feet. Only my hands. I get the feeling that's why it's hard to land the way I want to. I just can't get my toenails to dig into the ground like the claws on my hands. And I can't land flat on my feet from such a high jump because that's just plain painful. Wait a minute... You're not humans, are you?"

"No, we're not humans, silly. We've lost our animalization, or at least that's what mom says. Something about animalization being impossible in this day and age." Said Daisy, her eyes still full of curiosity. She couldn't take her eyes off Roxy's fluffy ears.

"Well, let's go back to the house, everyone's probably either doing nothing or talking about us." Said Stella. "Oh by the way, how do you know what to do when you're moving that fast?"

"I don't know, I just do. It's as natural as breathing. I see something in my way and I leap the other way. Nothing to it." Said Roxy, not realizing how much she really was flaunting her unique abilities.

The three sisters made their way back to the front porch, where everyone was waiting. Their mother was in awe. Roxy could jump even farther than she could when she was young. "Roxella, you're amazing! I never could've imagined you had so much of your grandfather in you!"

"That's nothing! I jumped the whole way to the top of the mansion earlier. Kinda messed up the landing on my way back down though..." Said Roxy, showing that her wrist had started to swell a little. It kind of hurt, but not that bad. But with everything that's happened today, Roxy wasn't sure if her sense of pain was normal either.

These sort of fun conversations went on well past dusk, when the group moved inside. Roxy found herself to be the topic of every conversation. Then at dinner, came the inevitable question.

"Hey, Roxella, what did you do the entire time you were missing. Surely you didn't just wait for us for almost 30 years." Asked Roxy's mother, a concerned look on her face.

"Well, that's pretty much what I did. I'm ashamed do say that I never thought of crossing the meadow and checking for scents on the other side. Dad told me that the forest was the only safe place for me. I did spend some time at a farm as someone's slave, but I broke free and returned to the woods before too long. Morons left only their kids to try to keep me in the basement."

"Surely you didn't kill those children, did you?"

"Of course not! I clawed up their arms and faces and left. Never saw any of them again. The father did come for me once. I just clawed him up and chased him back to the farm." Roxy didn't mention that when she was done chasing the man, she clawed up his chest and left considerable wounds.

"Either way, I'm just glad to finally see you again! My little miracle!"

"Why do you keep saying that? Surely I'm not the only one like this."

"I'm pretty sure you're one of a kind baby. Animalization is rare in this day and age. Especially one as complete as yours. Your sisters here can speak feline and they can somewhat follow scents, but that's all that was passed down."

"Well, I don't think I got all of it either... I don't have any claws on my feet and I have to whip my tail around to get my back to spring the right way for long jumps. Plus, if I am feline, shouldn't I have like pads on the underside of my feet or something?"

"Don't be ridiculous. Only beast cats have pads. They have paws, not feet."

"But dad said he knew people that had pads under their feet. Supposedly they could do everything I can do."

"I don't know where he saw this, but I'm sure it was nowhere around here. Not even anyone from the main family has pads under their feet."

With that, a maid announced that the group would be moving to the front room for dessert. Roxy just couldn't help herself... "Hey, are your ears real?" The maid answered this by removing her headband. "Nope. Yours?" Roxy flopped her ears back and forth and swished her tail around, showing off her extra abilities yet again.

With everyone taking a seat at the second table, the maids brought out a humongous cake and all these individual cups of ice cream! Roxy was in heaven yet again! The thing that worried her mother the most was how unfamiliar she seemed to be with everyday things like dinner and dessert. Perhaps she was telling the truth, and had truly spent her entire life in the forest with her human father. Speaking of which, she never did ask Roxy if she knew where her father was.

"Roxella. Do you know where your father went? He came by and told us you were taken away, and we never saw him again."

"No, I was hoping he was here somewhere."

Roxy's mother got lost in thought yet again. My dear husband, don't tell me you tried to make it alone in the woods. We all know that would be suicide.

After having way too much to eat, Roxy and her sisters made their way to the upstairs. Unbeknownst to Roxy, the maids had cleaned out her old room and prepared her bed and dresser as it was when she went missing. The only difference being the lack of baby clothes and new paint. One of the maids pulled Roxy aside and showed her to her room. Roxy was so excited! All this was for her! The maid informed her that the key to her door as in the dresser, and that the head maid had a spare key for emergencies.

With that, Roxy thanked the maid and went back downstairs.

"Everyone, I can't thank you enough for everything. Damien and Travis, you brought me back to everyone! And everyone here has been so kind to me! That being said, I think I'd rather live here. Although I wouldn't mind if you two came to visit some time. Oh and bring your pets too! Daisy and Stella are going nuts with Nala haha"

With that, the two young men put Nala back on her leash and headed back to the car. Naturally, they made it home without incident.

With the day being such an emotional rollercoaster, the three sisters ended up staying up until almost 3 in the morning. When they finally did go to bed, Roxy found herself unable to sleep. Her bed just wasn't doing it for her. It was twin size, and she couldn't curl up into the crescent moon shape like she always had. She went to bug a maid, and found one right down the hall. Roxy explained her situation, and the maid was honestly just perplexed. Everything Roxy did is what a cat would do. If she couldn't curl up on the bed, then she'd rather just curl up on the floor than lay on the bed like everyone else.

Having no idea what to do about this and not wanting their newest member to end up sleeping on the floor, she went and got the head maid. It was only a few minutes before a full size bed was brought in and swapped out with Roxy's twin size bed. Roxy did her little twirl, looking for that comfy spot, curled up, and fell right asleep. The maids couldn't believe their eyes! How had Roxy not known where this bed came from? Well that's just it, it was obvious that it smelled like Stella. Roxy just accepted Stella's kind gesture of switching bed sizes so she could sleep the way she wanted.

Roxy slept like a log, dreaming of endless forests filled with humans wearing headbands with cat ears.

In the morning, Roxy thanked Stella for switching beds with her. It had meant the world to her that somebody did that for her!

Stella only had one thing to say. "Did the maids tell you it was my bed? I told them to tell you it came from a spare room."

"Nope. It just smells like you."

End of part 3.

*003*2022-12-18 23:35

Part 4. In this section, I also drew inspiration from the Hotel Transylvania series of animated movies.

It's time to give Daisy and Stella some good descriptions.

Daisy was shorter, but well built. She did not feature any animal features and could not speak Feline or any other animal languages. She stood at 4' 11" and weighed in at 165 lbs. Some of that came from her slightly chubby figure. She wasn't overweight, just curvy. Her entire body had a sort of flow to it, nothing looked under or over proportioned. Her long light brown and orange hair brought out the green speckles in her otherwise brown eyes. She lacked the upright pupils, and everything else about her appeared human. That being said, it was obvious to Roxy that Daisy didn't smell like a human... She didn't quite smell the same as Roxy, but wasn't far off.

Stella was in the middle, standing at 5' 5" and weighing in at 170 lbs. She did not appear chubby, but had a little extra on her stomach. She lacked the flow that her sister Daisy had... Rather, her lower figure was straight and thin, while her upper figure was somewhat curvy. She did a lot of running and exploring, therefore she was never able to keep any chub on her legs. She also featured the same brown and orange hair as Daisy and Roxy, although none of her hairs changed color along their lengths. She lacked the green speckles in her eyes, appearing only brown while also lacking Roxy's upright pupils. She was more spry than her sister Daisy, but definitely didn't hold a candle to Roxy. She smelled a bit different than Roxy and Daisy, having a slightly human smell that lacked the pungent odor that humans carry with them. To be honest, Roxy didn't even notice the slightly human smell she had to her.

Story continues here, picking up at breakfast.

The family sat down at the long table, with the grandfather at the end, Roxy's mom at the other end and the youngsters taking the sides. Roxy took one side while Daisy and Stella took the other. It wasn't long before a conversation started.

A voice filled with the potency of an ox came across the table like some sort of shockwave. "Roxy. How did you not know that your rescuers were human? Those two have such a pungent odor to them. It's almost like they were advertising that they're only human."

Roxy stood up out of her chair, facing the large man at the end of the table with an intense stare. "I know they're human, but neither one acted like it. Damien never gave off any sense of aggression or hatred, and neither did Travis. They also have two animals living in the house, a dog and a cat. Both seemed loved and happy. While it's true that the duo can't speak the language of the animals that live with them, they still do their best to try and interpret what's being said. Both animals are happy living with those two young men. And for the short time that I was there, I was happy... Even though the city did seem odd and was far from my style."

"So... If someone's nice to you and makes themselves smell like they're not going to hurt you, you'll just trust them?"

"No. Of course not. I'm well aware I can't trust humans. But as I just said, these two didn't seem like the humans I've been told about. Besides, my father was human. He may not have been able to raise me the way you would have, but he truly cared about me. I owe him everything I know about survival in the wilderness. The things you can make out of the plants near you. How to hunt for food without making a mess or letting you prey suffer. How to respect the land around you... And most importantly of all, what to do when other humans come near you."

"I see. Perhaps not all humans are the same. Maybe some of them have started to change. I must admit, I was rather surprised when those two humans yesterday actually went and rolled in the grass to reduce their stench."

"No dip. You terrified them. Of course they did exactly what you said. It was the same for me when I was at the farm... At least, until I had enough and broke free."

Roxy's mom put a stop to the conversation as quickly as she could. Sighing, she raised her voice. "Dad. You know the man that took Roxy was under a contract from us. He did everything he could to keep Roxy safe. But with him being only human, it's only natural that he ended up not being able to fulfill his obligations. I ask that you not hate all humans. Didn't yesterday's duo prove that sentiment to no longer be correct?"

Roxy nodded to her mother, and sat back down. "What was my father's contract? He never said anything about it."

The grandfather once again unleashed his thunderous voice. "We'll talk about that later, when your sisters aren't here to overhear."

"Dad! How long do you intend to keep this a secret?! Even Roxy doesn't know! What harm could it do?"

"Well... hmmm... Here goes then. Roxy. Your father was a human who found this place all on his own. No other humans have ever managed that. He swore to help raise you in the wilderness, so that when the main family came back to check on us, we could report that I only had two grandchildren and neither one was fully animalized. They've got the hair, and Daisy has a hint of the eyes, but neither can communicate with the animals in the forest. Stella even has a slightly human smell to her, further adding to our alibi. We had your father gather herbs and make concoctions to erase your scent from the area before taking you away. Even my nose can't follow your scent across the meadow, so it was fair to say you'd be safe on the other side. That's when it all went downhill."

Roxy's mom chipped in. "None of us could find your or your father's scent, and neither Daisy or Stella were stupid enough to leave the mansion and its lawn. Honestly, we feared the worst. It seemed the main family had found you and taken you away. Once they had you, there would be nothing we could do to stop them from attacking again. Your grandfather here is one of the originals, a member of the main family. While your appearance is definitely feline like mine, your abilities and instincts great exceed what I could do back in my prime. You've got a lot of your grandfather in you. I'm not asking you to take part in the struggle with the main family.

We'll probably never see them again anyway. They abandoned us after your grandfather fought them off back when I was but a child. The battle was so intense that a portion of the great forest was completely destroyed. We worked to restore the soil and get grass growing there, careful not to erase the scent of battle. So many scents of me, your grandfather and the rest of the main family are all mixed up on that meadow that even we can't follow a scent across it. That's why we hid you on the other side of the meadow. We kept to ourselves for a decade, when the main family paid us a surprise visit. They were here f-"

Once again thundering across the table, the grandfather cut his daughter off once again. "Surprise my ass. We knew they'd come back, the only question was when. Your father's plan worked, his herbal concoction fooling the noses of our visitors. Some visitors they were. Rowdy as ever, they hurt your mother gravely. Unable to fully heal herself, she slowly slipped into a more human-like aging process. Even though she's rather brittle now, she still cares for this place and your sisters with all her heart. Of course, that includes you too Roxy."

"I don't get it. What would have happened if they'd found me?"

"They'd have killed your mother and sisters. Even I have grown rather brittle after the fight that left us stranded out here. I doubt I could pull that off again."

"So I'm some sort of secret... But what's so important about kids with beastly abilities?"

"Some moron at the head of the family decided they should be used as weapons. He sells them to the humans for a hefty price, in exchange for the promise that his family remain a secret. Some of the great heroes in battles throughout the ages have been animalized people like us, sold into slavery under the humans when they were only children. It's sad but true. That's why we had no choice but to hide you."

Roxy just sat there. It was all too much. She'd finally made it back to her mother and the rest of her family, but there was just so much going on. It seemed impossible. Shaking in her chair, she decided to speak up. "It's all too much. I think I'm gonna go see if I can help out in the kitchen. I don't know. I just need to clear my mind for a moment."

Her sisters just looked at each other, no idea what to do or say. It was all so much. Their sister was never taken... She was hidden for the safety of the entire family. And they'd never even heard about this main family aside from overhearing conversations between their mother and grandfather. Wait a minute though.

Stella broke the silence. "So if all that's true, why do only I smell like a human?"

"That's because your father was human. The man who took Roxy into the forest is the man who your mother fell for. I'm still not sure if that was wise or not. At least we got to keep you two, since you're not fully animalized. Neither is your mother, to be honest. she only possess feline abilities, and those have greatly diminished over the last couple decades. It's almost like everything got passed down to your big sister."

"True. I didn't even pick up on Roxy's scent until she was right in front of me. Even when I was in my prime, I could never run or leap the way she can. And she was just showing off. I don't think we got to see what she'd really be capable of if she was cornered or felt she had to fight back. With that in mind, I ask that we treat her as one of us. If she were to throw a real tantrum or turn completely against us, I doubt there's much we could really do." Roxy's mother said this as a warning to her daughters, completely unaware that Roxy had no opinion on this main family since she'd never met or even seen any of them. Her father had never mentioned any of them either.

Again, Stella just had to voice her curiosity. "So... Is it true then. If Roxy doesn't know where dad is, is he really just... Gone?"

Their father spoke up once more, this time in a much more manageable voice. "Unfortunately, I think that's likely the case. Humans aren't well equipped for survival in the wilderness. Without any claws or means of self defense, they end up as prey to larger animals like bear wild boar. Roxy said she hadn't seen him in over ten years, and that his scent was just gone. He probably passed away somewhere else so that Roxy wouldn't find him and find out."

The conversation sort of stalled out after that. Both sisters looking gloomy, the mood for breakfast had completely left them. Who knows if they'd be able to eat anything. The mother knew she had to eat to keep up the strength she had left, and the grandfather somehow always just dealt with stuff like this. It was like it didn't even faze him... Or maybe he was just used to it? Doesn't matter... The man had a heart of steel, and he didn't even realize that his unwillingness to buckle under stress was a big part of what kept the family together.

It only took a moment for Roxy to come back into the dining room, followed by the three maids with breakfast on separate plates. This was something new. Everyone was used to having a meal placed in the center of the table, then just grabbing whatever they wanted and putting it on their plates. This time, everyone had the same amount of everything.

The mother spoke up with a rather chipper voice, trying to hide the conversation that had just happened. "What's this, dear? Did you convince the maids to switch things up?"

"Yep. This is how the humans do it. I have to say, the breakfast they made me was so delicious, and the way everyone got the same amounts just felt like they were expressing how much they cared about me and each other. I don't know how to say it... It made the meal feel more personal."

"If that's what you wanted to do, why didn't you just call one of the maids out here and ask them to do it for you? There was no need for you to go to them."

"Huh? I told you, I wanted to step away and clear my mind. Sometimes just helping out can do wonders for cheering you up."

One of the maids spoke up, a rarity in this mansion. "Actually, it was rather refreshing. We mainly did it because she seemed so troubled, but once we started working together, it was rather fun. Plus she just has so much energy, it's only natural she's gonna need to get rid of some of it however she can."

Daisy and Stella again just looked at each other. A seed of a new idea had just started to sprout in their minds. What if they did more themselves, and relied less on the maids? If it worked for Roxy, it was worth a shot.

Roxy then took her seat and the group began a silent breakfast. It wasn't long before she was getting restless again. "You know, this isn't what I thought it would be. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but I've grown so accustomed to the forest that being trapped in here honestly feels kinda suffocating. I don't know what else to say."

Her mother again tried to lift everyone's spirits. "In that case, would you be willing to take your sisters with you to the other side of the meadow? They've never crossed the meadow at all, and they haven't left the mansion's lawn for over a decade. Maybe a little romping around would be exactly what everyone needs right about now."

"Yeah, sure. Dad showed me how humans do things like look for herbs, prepare shelters, track animals, that kinda stuff. Since Daisy and Stella here aren't like me, I feel like they'd need that sort of experience if they're ever going to be able to do much. Just because you can't jump to the top of a tree doesn't mean you can't get to the top. Vines can be twisted into a sort of rope and wrapped around the trunks of trees, giving you something to hold on to. You know, it's kinda funny. He taught me all these things and I honestly thought I'd never use them, yet here I am offering to teach it to you two. And why not show them where I grew up. It's not much compared to a mansion or a proper house, but most of the shelter is still standing. I did what I could to keep it that way. Dad did always think it was weird to use leaves and vines for a roof, but hey, it works."

"That sounds awesome! You have to show us sometime!" Chipped in Daisy, finally managing to lift her mood about the whole situation.

"Yeah! Let's do it! I'd love to see where you grew up!" Exclaimed Stella, her eyes watering and filling with reflections from the lights above.

It seemed like a happy ending was almost assured at this point. It'd be nice if they could get back on good terms with the main family, but it didn't seem like they'd ever see them again.

After finishing breakfast, Roxy and her sisters collected the plates, silverware and napkins from the table. They took them to the kitchen and handed them off to the maids to be cleaned. Just as Roxy had planned, her sisters were thrilled to finally have something they could do! Seeing as it was a rather warm day, the three trio changed into shorts before heading out.

They stopped and said goodbye to their mom and grandpa, promising to be back in a few hours at most.

Making it to the edge of the forest, the trio turned around and waved to their mom and grandpa. To their surprise, they were in fact waiving to every resident of the mansion! The maids and gardeners had all come to see the trio off! It may have only been for the rest of the morning and early afternoon, but it was the first time anyone had left the lawn in over a decade. With the exception of Roxy's mom trying to find Roxy whenever she felt able.

Once they made it to the forest, Roxy again changed. She stood still, taking in the scents and sounds of her surroundings. Tall trees full of healthy leaves, flowers in full bloom both on the ground and in the bushes, as well as a few deer in the distance. Roxy's nose twitched, her ears moved, and she gave a quiet "Shhhhhh" to her sisters.

Roxy pointed to her right, where there was a family of brown bears patrolling their their territory. She motioned for her sisters to follow her, instructing them to keep their voices down. And just like that, they'd gotten right past the bears' patrol. Completely unnoticed. Roxy then stopped again, took another smell of the area, and headed towards the meadow. She was following the smell of Nala, who had led her across the meadow to the mansion in the first place. Now she understood it. Nala's smell did blend in with the smells in the meadow, but her shampoo did not. This left a convenient scent trail for Roxy to follow. The grass was so tall and thick, it seemed Roxy was the only one able to notice the snakes all through it. She kept having to remind her followers to turn one way or the other, lest they run into a venomous snake.

Clearing the meadow, the trio found themselves at the edge of Roxy's old forest. With Roxy now following her own scent, it wasn't long before they arrived at her old shelter. It was a quaint little hideout, but it had kept her dry and out of the wind. Roxy showed them the walls, explaining how they were built, and showing what she'd done to keep them in okay condition over the years. She did the same for the roof. Attempting to climb to the roof proved difficult for the two sisters. 

They had a hard time getting a grip on the walls, nevermind having the strength to climb up. Roxy jumped back down, telling her sisters it was time for them to go for a ride. Roxy picked them both up, one on each side, and leapt onto the roof. Putting her sisters back down, she couldn't help but notice just how amazed they truly were! Wide-eyed and jumping for joy, the trio caved the roof in and fell with it. All three had managed to keep their feet under them, they were all fine. Roxy stood there embarrassed... Yeah, maybe that wasn't such a great idea she thought to herself.

Making sure nobody was hurt, Roxy took her sisters to another area of the forest. There, she showed them through different herbs and spices. While they could pick up on strong scents like wild onions, they completely missed the more subtle ones like Aloe. Roxy took time to explain each plant, what it looked and smelled like, and what it could be used for. Roxy had no idea that her healing abilities were turned up to 11, and just assumed that her sisters healed like she did. So when she explained Aloe, she just said it was for keeping cuts from burning for the first couple minutes before they close. Naturally, she was met with confused looks.

Stella spoke up in confusion. "If it's just for the first couple minutes, then what do we do after that? Is there something else around here for the next couple hours?"

"Well... If you cut yourself deep enough for it to not heal up in a couple minutes, you should wash it out in a stream and-" Roxy was cut off by Stella.

"What do you mean heal up in a couple minutes?"

"I mean stop hurting, and close up. The redness goes away a couple minutes after that... Right?"

"No. Not at all. A cut can hurt all day if not taken care of right away."

"How though?" Roxy said, extending claws and ripping into her forearm. She left 5 deep cuts, all completely through her skin. It only took a couple seconds for it to stop bleeding. After a couple minutes of talking about random stuff, she showed her arm again. It had completely closed up, with only minimal redness left.

"Amazing! So this is the sort of stuff grandpa can do... No wonder he put up such a good fight."

"Well, I haven't seen him in action, so I don't know for sure which one of us is more capable. Plus, isn't he old and brittle?"

"Well, yeah... But I've never seen anyone recover so quickly. Not even the maids, and they're more animalized than we are. Speaking of which, what do you do when you have to... You know..."

"Know what?"

Stella tried her best to hide her growing need for the toilet. "Oh, uh, nothing... Don't worry about it."

"You didn't get hurt when we fell, did you"

"No, that's not it. I'm fine."

Roxy showed them to a creek, explaining the dangers of unfiltered water and the germs that could be in it. Making a filter out of woven grass, and the pot and fire pit back at the shelter, Roxy got some water filtered and boiling. Her great strength and speed meant that she could get a fire going in less than 10 seconds with minimal effort. After the water boiled for a minute straight, it was declared safe to drink.

Having been exploring for 2 hours straight, the group was definitely feeling rather thirsty. Each consumed their fill of just over half a liter. To think Roxy filled up a 2 liter pot and carried it for over half a mile, then lit a fire with two sticks and some string right afterwards, and she still wasn't even out of breath. She really was amazing!

"Girls, I think we've made a lot of progress today. While you're not animals and don't have their abilities, there are ways to make up for that. The possibility of getting sick from bad water can be negated by filtering and boiling it. The possibility of getting sick by bad food can be negated by cleaning and boiling it. And there are plenty of herbs that are useful for covering your scent or adding flavor to your food. The forest offers so many ways to do things. To think nobody has every shown you this.

Stella's mind drifted in a slightly different direction... If only it had a toilet. God, I don't know how much longer I can go before I can't hide my squirming anymore. And all this water will only make it worse, although I guess I was pretty thirsty.

Finally, she broke the silence about her growing need. "What do you do when you have to use the toilet? I've been holding it in for over an hour now. I kinda gotta go pretty bad now."

"What do you mean? I just go. Although I guess you could walk over there somewhere if you're after some privacy? Like behind those shrubs or something." Answered Roxy, just now realizing her own brewing need.

"Are you kidding me?! I can't do that! That's disgusting!"

"Guess you'll just have to wait, then. I'm gonna go take care of my business behind those shrubs. I'll be right back." Said Roxy, feeling that if she does it, then maybe her sisters might be more comfortable doing it. After all, there's nothing more embarrassing than an accident in front of friends and family.

With that, Roxy took a stroll over to the bushes and disappeared behind them. After a moment, she reappeared and walked back over with a "Thank you for waiting."

Finally, Daisy took the opportunity as well. She was doing her best to hide it, but she was significantly more desperate than Stella. Her bladder was full to capacity, boiling inside her while she was waiting for a good time to ask. She ran over to the bushes and did her business, releasing a powerful stream that lasted over a minute! Apparently, she had been holding back quite the flood! She shuddered in relief, having rid herself of that pain. Walking back to the group, she too thanked them for waiting.

Roxy looked to Stella, who was shifting in place a bit. "Well, do you not want to go now? We can start back to the mansion, but do you think you can make it all the way? It's easily an hour walk at a human's pace."

"I guess I'll have to. There's no way I could relieve myself out here. That's just plain disgusting." Replied Stella, her bladder calling her a big moron for not taking this golden opportunity.

Roxy stomped the fire out before leading the trio back to the meadow. Good. Nala's scent is still strong here. This'll be a piece of cake. She thought to herself before once again leading her sisters through the meadow. Again, she had to keep tabs on her sisters, who never seemed to notice where the snakes were hiding. They repeatedly almost walked right into those snakes, prompting Roxy to repeatedly instruct them to turn one way or the other. This did slow progress a bit. When Roxy said it would be an hour to get back to the mansion, she hadn't accounted for this extra 10 minutes spent in the meadow.

The extra tall grass was a huge relief for Stella. Immediately after walking into the meadow and its chest high grass, she placed a hand on her crotch to help her hold on. She wasn't absolutely bursting yet, but she'd take any help she could get. That being said, her hand often ended up tugging at her shirt near her crotch instead of just holding her crotch. She had no idea why she did this, perhaps just a side effect of not being able to stay still anymore. She honestly felt like letting her thighs rub together, and once she was about halfway through the meadow, she did exactly this. God. Am I gonna make it back? I really don't wanna have to go out here. That's just so disgusting. But.. I wonder how long I can hold on. I can barely resist shoving both hands into my crotch right now! Little did she know, her distractions were keeping her from rather important info...

"STELLA! MOVE RIGHT!" Yelled Roxy, before jumping onto Stella and knocking her to the right! Even Roxy barely managed to pull her feet back from the rattlesnake taking a bite at her before slithering away! "Pay attention! When I say to take a step to the right, I need you to do it!"

Stella almost fell over in the collision, having been knocked a good 5 feet to the right. While she didn't fall or anything, the collision had taken its toll. She almost lost it there and then! There was nothing she could do but shove both hands into her crotch and hope the others didn't notice. She tried to ignore the warm, wet spot on her crotch. The size of a pinball, she feared it would soon grow. God damnit! How could I be so stupid! Of course I need to listen to Roxy! She's the only one that knows what to do out here.

From there on out, Stella's eyes never left Roxy. Luckily, they seemed to be past the worst of it. Roxy didn't find any more snakes, and the trio managed to take a straight path to the other side, where they continued towards the woods.

From time to time, Stella would stop and bend forwards. She walked with her hand jammed in her crotch, thighs rubbing together, and a look of tense concentration on her face accompanied by small tears forming in the sides of her eyes. A few more small spurts had escaped, causing her wet spot to expand to the size of a pair of tennis balls. Fuck man, I really can't do this much longer! We better get there soon or I'll never make it!

Finally, she could take no more, she simply had to speak up. Her voice wavered as she finally voiced her mind. "Hey uh... How much longer until we get there? I really gotta go here... I don't know... How much longer..." Her voice trailed off as her concentration shifted back to her hold... Man was she really fighting! She was holding back over 1 liter of boiling hot piss doing everything it could to get out!

"Only another 2 or 3 minutes and we'll be there, I promise. You think you can keep going, or you want us to give you some privacy?" Said Roxy, showing genuine concern in her eyes. Daisy did the same, the duo truly worried about Stella's hold. She looked like she was right on the edge of completely losing it!

"O-Okay... I'll try my best. I'm not going out here." Replied Stella, her bladder continuing its potent protests with another intense wave of pressure. She stopped walking, barely managing to contain the flood. It better be that quick. I can't do this much longer!

"I don't think she's going to make it..." Whispered Daisy to Roxy, who nodded in agreement. The duo walked slightly ahead of poor Stella, whose steps had gotten smaller now that she didn't have a choice but to keep her legs together and walk slightly hunched forward. Somehow, desperate Stella was keeping her floodgates closed.

"Look! It's the mansion! You made it!" Yelled Roxy, her voice filled with excitement!

"I dunno... I can barely walk. Can you carry me there please? I really can't keep going..." Said Stella, beginning to sob under the pain and pressure boiling inside her.

"S-Sure... I can do that." Answered Roxy, picking her sister up and running as smoothly as she could. She held desperate Stella with an arm under her shoulders and the other under her knees. Stella was effectively bent in half and had both her hands shoved in her crotch with all her might! Her entire body was trembling! Poor Stella's tears had left her eyes and were streaking down her face. Roxy had better hurry, or she'd be losing another fluid very soon!

Unfortunately, Roxy wasn't able to hold a very good pace. She's not used to running on just her legs, and she needed to make sure she didn't bounce or shake... It'd probably take her another 30 seconds to get to the other side of the lawn. Nevermind inside and up the stairs.

Only 10 of those seconds passed before poor desperate Stella, shaking under the boiling pain insider her, finally started to lose her hold. Another hot spurt escaped her! A few hot drips escaped her shorts entirely and soaked into the bottom of Roxy's shirt! It took all her might to stop that boiling hot spurt!

Now crying more profusely, poor desperate Stella could only beg for relief to come as soon as possible. Fuck fuck fuck I can't do this I can't do this it's coming out!!!!! "I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE! BEHIND THOSE BOLDERS IS FINE! SET ME DOWN THERE! HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY! HURRY HURRY HURRY!" She begged Roxy to go faster!

A few more drips escaped as the trio dashed for the space between the front boulders and the side of the house. A small, secluded space with shrubs on the other side. A perfect place to release her boiling flood!

Roxy set poor Stella down, who couldn't stand up straight at all! She immediately doubled over, bursting into the most frantic pee dance anyone had ever seen! Slipping her hands inside her panties and crushing her pussy under the force of every muscle in her body, she frantically called for help!

"MY PANTS! I CAN'T LET GO OR I'LL BURST! SOMEONE GET MY PANTS OFF!"

Roxy attempted to help, but with Stella moving around so frantically, she just couldn't get a good grip of the zipper on the poor girl's shorts! The desperate dance continued for another few seconds, Roxy continuously trying to get the zipper down.

Suddenly, a painful cry escaped Stella as she continued sobbing! A powerful stream fell from her crotch to the ground! Her pee dance still going, her hands still frantically trying to stop the flood! It was no use, she was past her limit. Her boiling hot load burst out of her with incredible force! It was pushing through her panties and the fabric of her denim shorts! It was falling from her crotch to the ground, shooting out of her pockets and running down her legs, and dripping to the ground from the ends of the leg holes on her soaked shorts! This continued for almost an entire minute, before she finally stopped.

Now full on crying, poor Stella collapsed in her own puddle. She was quickly taken inside where she took a shower and deposited her old clothes into the washer set to Rinse And Spin, before combining them with the rest of her dirty clothes and starting the machine.

Huh. Wonder where the maids were this whole time...

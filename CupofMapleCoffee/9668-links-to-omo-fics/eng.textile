I'm not the author of any of these fics, but they are ones that i have enjoyed and would like to share. I'm not sure if anyone has already posted these, if so my apologies.

There were others that i wanted to share that were original stories, not fanfictions, but i cant seem to find them. One involved a merman or merboy and there was one about being stuck in an elevator...I guess I'll just share those later

The merman might be this one

. Maybe. I don't know what the second one is, though.

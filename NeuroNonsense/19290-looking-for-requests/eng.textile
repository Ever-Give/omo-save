When I first made an account here, I posted this story: https://omorashi.org/topic/10262-a-golden-opportunity/

Since then, I disappeared for a while, and rarely checked my own threads. So it was only just now that I saw the couple replies on that, and it wasn't much, but it really made me want to start writing again. Not just omo, but in general.

So what scenario would people enjoy?

And to Anathema and desp_1999, thank you very much for your compliments and words of encouragement, regardless of how long it took me to get them. I made this post because of you guys. ^_^

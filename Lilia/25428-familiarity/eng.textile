I've recently been feeling like writing again! Apologies for having abandoned my previous story about a certain bladder sprite. So here's my newest original fiction story, which will still probably be split into 'chapters'. I'm still keeping with the fantasy genre this time, but instead of cheeky sprites, you get demons and witches, and yet another begrudging relationship which seems to be a trope I enjoy.

###

The streets of the world of demons were filled to the brim with the busy greedy people that inhabited it. With skins in various shades of reds, purples, and grays, feathered and fleshy wings, curled horns of various lengths, and pointed tails, the demons were certainly an unusual folk. The entire town road was lined with buildings made of brimstone bricks, and the vast majority of them were places of leisure - casinos full of gamblers, spas with magma baths and hot coal treatment, restaurants offering human flesh in a million different varieties, bars serving drinks hotter than fires, brothels where the succubi and incubi gave their sort of service to the others, and a few places that were pleasurable for devils moreso than to human readers, and are best left undescribed. Not a single citizen had to work, for their money was obtained from the souls of the damned that had no use for their worldly wealth anymore.

Within one of the casinos, a crowd had gathered around a poker table, and whilst the majority of the devils there were townspeople, there was a particular guest of honor that had captured a few staring eyes. A girl sitting at the far end of the table was adorned in plenty of gold and silver and gemstones, with silken finery and leather sandals. But that wasn't the most unusual thing about her. Her skin was no common red or maroon, but a shiny jet-black, the color of soot. The webbing in her small wings and the color her irises were both highlighted in a royal violet, and these features, coupled with her outfit, made her easily identifiable as royalty.

For she was Selehpot Sihpem, and anybody hearing her surname would know that she was the daughter of the Unholy One, the lord of the demonic realm, the most powerful black sorcerer currently in existence, and she was as respectable as her father, partly because of her nobility, partly because of her exotic and beautiful appearance, and partly because she was winning the game by far at the moment. This particularly astounded her fellow players, because this delicate-looking princess, with her fine wings, skinny figure and less-than-average stature, was evidently one of the best poker players Big Temohpab's Casino had ever seen.

But unbeknownst to her fellows, she possessed some abilities that even they didn't, including a mystical charm that made them all so dumbfounded at her appearance that they didn't notice when she gazed around at all of their hands. She was a selfish free spirit, who had little respect for others, and simply loved winning, living in her luxuries, and the power and respect her position offered her. In fact, had anybody tried to raise her like a human, they would have found that even UK reality TV parenting specialist Supernanny couldn't handle a brat like that. But her father had ignored her for the better part of her childhood, and now, at sixteen, she was almost of age and almost ready to cast a hand into the ruling of the demonic plane. For now, however, she spent most of her days basking in the praise of the townspeople and wasting the dead's money on her simple pleasures.

In fact, Selehpot had a bit of a hard time bringing herself away from these pleasures. She was royalty, and thus it wasn't often that she had to give anything up. But unfortunately, her own body put restrictions in place. Right now, her bladder seemed rather unhappy at her for consuming three glasses of Big T's Brimstone Brandy and then proceeding to play card games for two and a half hours. So reluctantly, she left the table after winning yet another round, and made her way to the bathrooms in the back of the place.

Entering the single-stall bathroom, she caught a glance of herself in the mirror, and ever the vain type, she admired her ashen skin, as unblemished, dark, and lacking any visible hue as always, and her similarly colored hair, which was practically as silken as her clothes. Then, sighing, she reached down to pull down her silken skirt, which was as light and cool as the wind, and then immediately gasped and hiked it back up, for the state of the toilet was... well, let's just say that drunken demons aren't the most.... clean... people in the underworld.

There was no way she could use this, not a chance. So frustrated, she stormed out of the room. A princess shouldn't have to be exposed to something like that. Her bladder was still filling by the minute, although at the moment, it was tolerable, and she could certainly move without even so much as having to grab herself. In fact, she figured that it really wouldn't be too hard to sit and play more poker for an hour. But she also wanted another herbal bath today, and another massage from that maidservant Natas, so she decided it was best to just return to the palace for now. The walk would only take ten minutes.

The palace itself was situated in the centre of the town, made of obsidian and black stone, sitting atop a great rock and surrounded by a moat of magma. It was very intimidating, and the knowledge that she lived in it made Selehpot feel all warm inside. When eventually, she did get home, she breathed in the hot, hellish air (which was very refreshing for her kind), and made her way to her towers. There, in the luxurious chambers she changed out of her current outfit and donned a more casual home outfit, a black silken gown that was so thin it was translucent. In fact, with the heat, it might have been comfortable to just go around in the nude, but such a respectable person as herself would never do something like that.

Then, finally ready to resolve herself of that annoying little problem in her lower abdomen, she wandered to her bathchambers, dismissed the servants who asked if she was ready for a bath, hiked her gown up to her waist and pulled her undergarments to her feet, and then she felt the room begin to shake.

This, of course, was completely unexpected. Selehpot stood up, hurriedly pulling her clothes back on in confusion. She attempted to leave the bathroom to look out the window and see if the tower was collapsing or something like that, but found she couldn't move at all. This made her panic, and the princess started to shout for help. Her maids called back, but she had locked the door. She looked down, and to her horror, saw a magic circle about her feet. It began to spin and glow, and the servants' voices grew quieter and quieter, until they were a whisper and the room was only a faint memory, and she was soaring through a tunnel of shadows and lights, and she thought she was going to die, or worse, but it all ended rather suddenly when she felt herself fall onto a cold metal surface.

She was too stunned to get up at first, so the first thing she heard was a voice.

"Ah, excellent. A magnificent specimen."

This prompted Selehpot to turn around, and gaze at the owner of the voice. It was a human, and a sorceress, judging by her ornately robes and hood. They were in a tower, it looked like, full of bookshelves and strange equipment and enchanted things - a wizard's home if she'd ever seen one. But probably the most prominent thing about the demon princess's new surroundings was that she was currently contained within a cage.

Try as she might, none of her hellfire could melt it, her strong hands couldn't tear it, and she eventually started to swear at the mage in front of her, but that only prompted the woman to laugh. She was rather young, at least judging by her voice and shadowed face, although much of her appearance was obscured by her robes and cloak.

"You're not going to escape that cage. And even if you did, you couldn't attack me or leave, because I summoned you. Like it or not, demon, you're my servant now, and you'll be doing whatever I tell you to do."

This, of course, made Selehpot furious, and her curses grew worse and the rattling of the bars became louder. But the sorceress waved a hand, and the demon felt her entire body go limp, and she collapsed to the floor of the cage again. Standing up, she almost tried it again, but realized it would probably be a stupid idea.

"I'm going to let you out, now." her captor said. "You wouldn't be of much use to me otherwise." Her voice sounded almost teasing, and it was infuriating. "I've got bookshelves that need dusting, and you should be able to reach them just fine with those wings of yours.

The cage opened, and immediately, Selehpot flew at the sorceress, screaming, "Do you even know who I am, you peasant? I am the Unholy Heiress, Princess Selehpot Sihpem, and-", but didn't get any further than that before she was frozen in place and felt her voice break.

"Completely under my control." reminded the mage. "Now. Bookshelves, my new servant. And make it quick, because I've got more work I don't really feel like doing!~"

Selehpot stood up, and was at once reminded of that nagging little urge in her bladder as a small, tolerable wave of desperation hit her. "Can I at least-", she began to ask, but was interrupted.

"We'll see how obedient you are first. I've no desire to endlessly torture you, so perhaps if you do what you're told, we can learn to be friends. After all, a familiar is a partner for life. And if I'm you're friend, I'll surely give you some privileges."

She was definitely young. She didn't sound commanding like a superior, no. She sounded like a child enjoying a fun little game. In fact, Selehpot would go so far as to guess that their ages were similar. So that's how it was to be, thought the dishonored princess as she picked up a feather duster, trying to ignore her full bladder. Her, a princess! A princess among demons! And now, a silly witch's familiar, forced to work, and trying not to wet herself. How absolutely deplorable.

To anybody who was looking forward to this, sorry for disappearing! I've been unexpectedly busy with life but now that it's summer I'll probably have more time, so expect this story to continue! Poor little Selehpot's been holding it for several months now so I've got to give her some relief.

*010*2015-07-20 18:27

Selehpot had no idea what an alembic was, what its purpose was, or why it was significant to her new 'master', but it was a completely ridiculous shape that made it impossible to clean and the small green stain on the inside that she had been trying to reach for the past five minutes seemed to be taunting her at this point. It had been half an hour so far since she was given her first task of cleaning the sorceress's alchemical equipment and so far she had cleaned up exactly two piles of broken glass and one spilled jar of rat bile. None of which were damaged accidentally.

Obviously, her first course of action was to furiously refuse to perform any task that she was given and to defiantly try and mess stuff up for the pathetic human witch, but she quickly discovered that each bit of misbehavior prompted the girl to delay dinner by an hour. The first time, Selehpot had laughed and refused to believe it. She was royalty and had always eaten whenever she wanted to, but after the second time she realized that the sorceress was serious, and had responded with outrage by throwing the bile at her.

At this point it looked like she wouldn't be eating until the evening. But even if she was slightly hungry, she had other pressing issues too. Her need for the bathroom hadn't lessened at all. In fact, at this stage, it was pretty impossible to ignore. Her lower body swayed from side to side as she leaned over the apparatus table, her thin tail flicking in discomfort. If she were alone, she would have been grabbing herself, but that pest of a sorceress was watching her work from afar, and the last thing she wanted to do was show weakness in front of a human.

She decided to put down the stupid piece of glass she was trying to clean for now and come back to it later, because it was only making her more and more frustrated. There were a few vials that had to be rinsed as well. In the name of everything unholy, she thought, couldn't this woman clean up anything after herself? The table had a small sea rune in the corner that produced a small stream of water, and she used this to wash out the vials, but the feel of the liquid against her fingers and the gentle trickling noises made her painfully aware yet again of the fact that she had to pee. It wasn't even a discomfort at this point, it was an annoying pestilence clinging to her and getting in the way of everything.

Eventually, she finished cleaning everything but the stupid stained alembic. She couldn't believe all this work she was being forced to do. That mage had better have some excellent reward for her, she thought. She had cleaned like, ten entire things. That was more things than anybody should have had to cleanse in their entire life, much less someone whose lifespan was going to be several thousand years. She figured since she'd done such a good job, it wouldn't hurt to ask for a bathroom break.

"Hey." she said, turning to face the sorceress. "Do you think-"

She cut Selehpot off. "You'll either address me as mistress, my lady or by name."

The demon's face contorted into a scowl. "Fine then, Mirianne." she replied, spitting out the girl's name like it was dung. She'd die before calling somebody else her master. "Show me to your bathroom."

Mirianne stepped over to the workspace. "So rude." she answered. "I'd appreciate it if my little familiar would treat me with a bit of respect."

This was enough for Selehpot. She screamed in frustration and smashed the alembic on the ground, where it shattered. "I am NOT your SERVANT!" she hollered in rage. "I am Selehpot Siphem, eldest daughter of the Almighty Unholy One, Heiress to the Brimstone Throne, and one of the most beautiful and precious demons in the universe, so I do believe YOU should be the one treating ME with respect at the very least! If you were seated before me, you'd be on your knees and begging for my forgiveness, and-"

At this point she felt her lips lock shut, and she could only faintly scream in fury through a closed mouth. "I would have let you go had you been a bit more polite, but now that I think about it, maybe your bladder can teach you some manners. Your answer is no!" Mirianne said, and giggled, as if this was some massive joke to her. Selehpot could only stare, dumbstruck. Well, not that she could speak anyway, but if she could, she still wouldn't be. This ignorant human was despicable.

"You'll clean up that alembic and then... hmm..." The mage gazed slowly around the room. "I was going to have you reorganize some books, but I've got a special job for you now. I've got a cursed pitcher that's supposed to supply me with an endless amount of water, but it's been misbehaving and spitting water at me for a while now. Your kind are adept with curses and black magic and the like, aren't you? I'd like you to try and fix it for me!" It's right over in this chest here.

Selehpot watched as the sorceress opened a wooden box and a small flood of water spilled out onto the tiled floor. Within was a jug of water that emitted a relentless stream of water, almost seemingly in rage, if it was possible for an inanimate object to feel anger.

She was enjoying this, Selehpot thought as the sight of the water pushed her urge even further and forced her to shamefully rub the crotch of her undergarments for relief. Her, a princess. What a sick hag.

Tada! The first new chapter in too long. Just so you know, I'm open to suggestions, so let me know what kind of things you'd like to see happen. And feel free to ask anything too.

Hi, I've been busy again and kind of losing my motivation to continue this. So this story's probably seen its end, at least for now. Expect more from me in the future, though. I suppose I shouldn't try to write multi chapter stories when I get bored this easily, oops.

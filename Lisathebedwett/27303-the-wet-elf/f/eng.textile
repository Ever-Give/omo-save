Hello this is my first fic so be kind.This takes place in the warcraft universe.

Jen was a night elf who lived near goldshire.She was a nice shade of purple that wore blue jeans a red shirt and had hair dyed blue.She by most people was smoking hot but always rejected men becouse she was a lesbian.She never had a lasting relationship for long because of one thing.She was a bedwetter.

She went to the tavern alot and she rarley came out with dry jeans.Jen was lonley alot because there are not many lesbians around and even if there were they didnt accept her being a bedwetter.one day she was aproached by a cute little human.she was blond had some plate armor and a sword on her back.The human said "hey there elf why are u alone" the efl responded with a sigh "im a lesbian and noone else here is and if there is any when they hear im a bedwetter they dump me" tears formed in her eyes."Hey now dont cry uhm if u want ill let u join me on an adventure"

"A rouge has no place with a warrior" the human laughed "hey now dont say that your proboly a great rouge"

"Even if i did go with you i would pee in my sleep" the human looked at her "hey its ok i dont mind because then i would be a hippocrate" the elf looked back "wait are you a..." the human responded "yep im a bedwetter too and im ok wih that" well ok ill go with you lets go to my house"

When they reached the house jen got ready while the human girl waited "never got your name elf", "j-jen my name is jen", "samantha but just call me sam" the elf nodded but looked to the floor as her corgi compannion whimpered "wanna join us fluffy", "Bark bark", "lets go" they set off into the woods.

Later that night the two girls talked about past relationships "soo she told evryone ypur a bedwetter" the elf nodded "yep and oddly some men obsessed over me even more its so creepy", "hey dont worry i wont be a bitch", "Woa watch the lanuige my corgi might hear you", "he can't understand us", "I'm joking" the human laughed "sure you are" the elf pondered and said "what was your last relationship like" sam responded "it was wih this girl who convinced me to try being a lezbian it went good untill she tried to kill me" jen went wide eyed "Holy shit for real" sam nodded fluffy curlled up and went to sleep "well we should turn in for the night" okay jen ill put out the fire" just then sam noticed jen hold her crotch "gotta pee?"

"Yhea im thinking about letting go here"

"go ahead i wont mind" after that was said pee gushed out of jen,s panties and into her pants it mad a small puddle to the ground.By the time she finished her jeans were soaked "i wonder if ill still wet my bed or sleeping bag" sam responded wih a shrug and fell asleep jen did the same.The next day they BOTH had wet sheets "heh you still bed wet"

"I know but so did you" just then sam pressed her lips on jens and pulled away and said "I think this will be a butiefull and wet relationship and they started kissing again.

It was morning when they set out and jen couldnt help but ask "where are we going to anyway" sam responded "booty bay taking the boat to ratchet then we head to gadgetzan" jen responded with a nod and figeted in her clothes "gotta pee jen jen?"

"Yhea and badly" sam giggled "just go on your pants i wont care" a hiss was heard from jen and a sigh from her as well and moved on soon they heard blood elevs the horde. The horde were not common here but appeer time to time "lets take em out and loot em" at that command jen took out the warglaives and went into stealth while sam charged in jen backstabbed one elf kioling her instantly while the other farted and crapped herself pleading for mercy crying pooping and urinatng herself. Jen decided to kill her anyways with a dirty look from sam "what the hell jen"

"I hate the horde they took my family my freinds and left me for dead I WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO KILL THEMALL"

"I'm sorry i didn't know" jen and sam continued on utill they got to the elwyn forsst and darkshire border.

Sam woke up with a wet bed as usual but jen woke up holding her crotch bed slightly damp jen just let go laying down on the bedroll. They continued on their journey fought bears wolves and stopped at a nearby town for re supply. After some drinks sam felt a urge to pee and left with jen. Sam pissed her pants and jen stomach made a srange sound "uh oh", "what is it jen", "i have to poop and i cant undo my jeans i-i really have to poop", "uhn well u could u know just... go" jen didnt want this but she knew her only option was to crap her pants.

Sam looked as jen,s eyez cilled with tears as her backside bulged out and started to look brown "FUCKING GOD DAMNIT" jen screamed sam understood why "if u want i have to kinda poo i could go to if you want", "you would shit your pants for...me", "of course i would i love you" sam grunted as her pants bulged and browned she sliced carefully and removed her clothing infront of jen and jen did the same "here u can borrow some panties and jeans the jeans are plate but its all i got", "its fine".

They set up camp and jen said its kinda hot out and sam nodded and thats when jen stripped down to her bra and panties and the human looked at the half naked elf and all she could say was "holy shit your hot". TIME SKIP 5 MINUTES LATER. Sam and jen were both in the same bedroll completley naked humping moaning kissing and cumming. "OH G8D YES" jen screamed as they ended "so.. that was nice"

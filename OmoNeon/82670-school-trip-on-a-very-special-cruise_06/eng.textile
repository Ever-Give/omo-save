Chapter 22 - Accidents happen

_________________________________

They all chuckled and even Peyton couldn't help but grin at this point. Luna hadn't missed the ever so slight change in Peyton's reaction to their latest change in toilet behaviour.

Liv now asked stunned, "Peyton already told me about it earlier while waiting in line, but i can't believe you guys are actually just doing it on purpose!"

"We're not nearly the only ones doing it." Luna replied, hinting at the people at the party with wet pants.

Selena quickly added, "Just look at how many people there are at the party, and then look at the capacity of the toilets. You kind of have your answer already."

The topic changed and the group continued chatting and had fun while chilling at the railing. Small groups of people sometimes walked by their spot to go find a place to relieve themselves, mostly guys and all with still dry pants.

They were experiencing the effect first hand of how the drug and many (sometimes alcoholic) drinks were causing their bladder to fill up rapidly.

The passing people didn't stop Luna though, she had felt a tingle in her bladder a while ago and by now her bladder was really starting to get full again, without overthinking it like she usually does she relaxed her bladder and let it's contents flow freely, rewetting her clothes while she was still cuddling with Chloe.

"I think your girlfriend sprung a leak!" Vicky said while grinning.

Luna was enjoying the warm glow she felt in her crotch, soon followed by the warm sensation flowing down her legs and in her shoes further soaking her clothes. Within seconds a new puddle was forming under her feet while she was still mid stream.

Liv let out a gasp, "I can't believe you're doing that! You're just... peeing in your clothes?!" Liv said in utter disbelief,

And enjoying it!" Luna replied smug, "I'm still going by the way."

The alcohol was definitely boosting her confidence right now but Luna didn't feel in the slightest embarrassed about peeing her pants, not even when some people were passing by.

"Are you seeing this? Chicks aren't even trying to find a toilet anymore!"

"Yea man, but can you really blame them?"

After the two guys had passed a couple followed right after.

The guy asked his girlfriend, "So where are you gonna pee? I found a spot to pee earlier but what are you gonna do now?"

"I'm actually bursting, even if i go stand in that long line now at the toilets i don't think i'll make it." The woman replied, "Honestly i've seriously contemplated following those girls lead and piss myself."

"Hey it's your pants so it's your choice, i'm not gonna stop you." The guy said carefree, as if he hadn't really said anything out of the ordinary to his girlfriend just now.

"Screw it, i'm gonna hold it for a little longer but soon i'm gonna let go in my pants like those girls there did."

They couldn't hear the rest of the conversation as the couple walked further away from them, but surely everyone in their group had just heard how the women had acknowledged she was soon gonna wet her pants.

Liv was clearly shaken by this recent revelation, "You're all being weird right now."

"Look at the puddle you made!" Chloe said while ignoring Liv,

Luna let out a sigh of relief. "Ooooh that's so much better!"

Luna shook off the last drops from her legs that dripped down in the large puddle they were standing in.

That's the second time tonight she had emptied her full bladder into her pants, and she very much intended to keep doing it for the remainder of the night. Just then Luna noticed the puddle at their feet was expanding again, with a glance down she saw droplets coming down from Chloe's shorts and leggings while they got shiny again with pee flowing down from them.

She looked up and got greeted by Chloe who was beaming with content as she was relieving herself while still having Luna in her embrace.

"Well that's nice for you guys i guess, but not everyone is ok with having an accident so..." Liv seemed a bit fidgety when she spoke up, "So are we gonna head back? I need to pee again and the line is..."

"Oh Liv for fuck sake, you're wearing a dress!" Vicky cut her off, "Only your panties will get wet!"

Luna responded in a bit more understanding way, "Liv you'll stand in the line for the toilets more than you'll be enjoying yourself tonight, just follow our lead and you'll have more time to enjoy yourself?"

The others agreed while Peyton seemed to be deep in her own thoughts.

"I-I can't just pee myself!" Liv seemed to shudder at that thought alone. "What about you Peyton?"

Peyton shrugged, "I kind of need to pee as well."

"Hey if you guys want to go you can, we're just gonna stay here for a bit longer." Selena remarked,

To Luna's surprise both Liv and Peyton stayed, while a new topic got started and they carried on chatting. Meanwhile an employee came around with a cart with non alcoholic drinks and they all eagerly took one as they were all getting thirsty once more.

After a while Both Liv and Peyton seemed to be fidgeting, they definitely were getting desperate. Liv started to nervously look around towards the direction of the toilets while Peyton seemed to be more calm.

Luna wondered, seemed like peer pressure was doing it's thing as they realized they were in the minority.

"Ok move over i really need to pee!" Peyton suddenly exclaimed,

For a second Luna was wondering if Peyton was gonna follow their lead and wet her hot jeans shorts but she was wrong. It was just now that no other people were passing by and she was using this moment.

Peyton calmly said, "Give me some cover if you can please."

Peyton squatted at the railing, pulled her jeans shorts and panties to the side revealing her bare pussy, immediately a jet of pee shot out of her and off of the side of the ship. She peed for well over a minute before she was finally done.

Just as she was done and jumped up letting her panties and shorts snap back in place some people showed up.

"Ah fuck i got some on my shorts," Peyton was checking the damage, she had been a bit to quick and careless and the back of her shorts now had a wet patch.

They all assured her it wasn't a big deal.

"No shit you think it's not a big deal, you're all standing in soaked pants yourselves!" Peyton reluctantly agreed. "I guess it's not a big deal though."

Liv was now hopping from one foot on the other, "Wait, that was your plan? I thought you had a better plan! I need to pee as well, and badly!"

"Do like Peyton or take the easy way, just spread your feet apart and let go in your panties." Chloe assured her,

Liv ignored what Chloe had said and just continued fidgeting while their conversation went on.

Luna and Chloe were telling their story that had happened with Emma, the Karen and Doctor Neuhaus. While it was very entertaining to them the conversation quickly went back to Liv's need again, they tried to help her and all started to give her tips on what is the best way to relieve herself.

Peyton: "Just squat and pull your panties to the side and let go!"

Luna and Chloe: "Just spread your feet and let go, it doesn't matter if other people see it."

Vicky: "Just pee, it's no problem if your panties get wet. The shoe drying thing in your room also works great for your shoes!"

Selena: "Lean on one foot and bend your knee, like this!" Selena was balancing on one foot with her other leg bend. Luna wasn't sure what that would get her but she quickly found out as Selena started a demo.

Selena's pants were getting shiny with wetness when she started peeing again, but this time with the way she was standing most of her pee streamed down only one of her pants legs and splattered down from her knee on to the ground.

"That way your socks and shoes stay dry but with a skirt or dress it's also less suspicious for onlookers!" Selena explained.

Wow she really had thought this through.

They didn't further pressure Liv what to do, something their group never did and Luna liked that about them.

In the end Liv chose the Peyton way and they all helped to give her some cover so she could squat and got her panties out of the way to relieve herself without getting her clothes wet.

When Liv was all done they found their way back to the party and back to the dance floor.

Soon Luna was back to bouncing around the dance floor like a ball of energy together with the others.

Every time Luna felt a tingle in her bladder her heart started racing, a moment later she was enjoying the warm and wet sensation that would flow down her legs. The others were probably doing the same except for Peyton and Liv.

Liv would frequently disappear, it was clear that she was still struggling keeping up with getting to a toilet in time every time she needed to go, which was very often considering all the drinks they were having combined with the effects of the drug.

Peyton however... she finally got tired of finding a toilet every time and her way of dealing with her over active bladder was just squatting and pulling her panties and shorts to the side like she had done earlier. Sometimes with a minimum amount of cover meaning she must have flashed a bunch of people throughout the night.

With more and more drinks she was also getting more and more sloppy with getting her shorts out of the way, resulting in the wet spot on the back of her shorts getting just a bit bigger again when she returned from her latest pee.

Peyton was inspecting the damage on her shorts, "Oh my god i'm getting my panties and shorts wet!" she didn't actually sound too upset though.

Selena opened her mouth and sarcasm poured out in it's purest form, "yea i think my pants are starting to get wet as well!"

Her comedic timing was brilliant and Vicky spit out some of her drink while everyone burst out in laughter.

"Bitch i was drinking!" Vicky blurted out with with her drink coming out of her nose,

They were all trying to regain their composure when Selena started laughing again while pointing at Chloe.

Luna looked to her side where Chloe was standing just to see her shorts and leggings were all shiny with fresh pee cascading down her legs. Chloe her face was all red while uncontrollably laughing and peeing herself at the same time.

Everyone burst out in laughter again while Luna could see a small puddle was slowly forming at Chloe's feet.

"I can't help it, it just started coming out!" Chloe blurted out while laughing,

"Haha... wait you had a real accident?" Luna asked while wiping away some tears,

Chloe her stream had subsided and she regained her composure, "Yea i couldn't stop it from coming out even if i wanted to."

"Well to be fair..." Chloe sheepishly added, "Not that i really wanted to stop it though."

Chloe quickly waved it away and a lot was going on at the same time while people were still dancing around them. The incident was quickly forgotten.

Even with the loud music around they had drawn some attention from all their laughing by now but now that the DJ started a new song and everyone was having a good time everything went back to normal pretty quickly.

Vicky and Peyton were socializing with some guys while Selena said it was time for drinks, Liv was nowhere to be found so Chloe offered to help but wanted something from the grill as well, which happens to be more in the middle of the deck while the bars were on the outside.

"Don't worry i'll get it, i also wanted another snack anyway." Luna said, "We'll meet up after."

Before they could take off Luna got surprised by a spontaneous Chloe that flew around her neck and gave her a long kiss on the lips.

"Get a room you two!" Selena shouted jokingly,

Chloe finally let go, turned around and went on their way while she shouted behind her, "Thanks babe!"

Luna was perplexed, while still heavily blushing she went on her way towards the grill that was situated more in the middle of the deck. She wondered how many people saw that.

It wasn't unwanted but she definitely felt a bit shy knowing so many people must have seen that kiss.

Also... did Chloe just call her 'babe'

She chuckled a little, it was funny how it had come this far that she was more comfortable wetting herself in public than kissing her once best friend turned girlfriend.

While walking she had a bit of a mini revelation, she figured it's because so many other people around her simply didn't give a damn about wetting their own pants that it felt more accepted.

Some dude with a big ass sombrero suddenly jumped in front of her surprising her, "Ay caramba!"

She laughed at the guy and waved him away while dancing with him for a few seconds.

Seconds later Luna got in line waiting to order their food. Her mind wandered back to what happened between her and Chloe in their room before going to the restaurant and she couldn't help but get flustered thinking about it. She hadn't forgotten the promise she had made either and was looking forward to when they would get to their room.

Luna suddenly got surprised when she could feel a hand on her shoulder, for a second she thought it was Chloe who had followed her... But when she turned around she realized she couldn't have been more wrong.

"Well aren't you two the cutest couple together." Caitlyn said with sarcasm in her voice,

Luna was surprised but went immediately in defense mode, being alert for any bullshit Caitlyn had planned this time. On second glance, her friends didn't seem to be around her like last time.

Luna didn't want to deal with her, her evening had been great so far and she liked to keep it that way, she tried to get rid of her, "Just leave me alone."

"Hey i just saw you two being all over each other and what not and thought i wanted to have a little chat." Caitlyn said while quickly taking a sip from her drink.

Luna had the feeling that this time Caitlyn wasn't out for evil, at least it seemed that way. She kept being alert for any sign of her usual evil self, but she couldn't help to notice she wasn't completely stable on her feet. How many drinks did she have tonight?

"Hey what's with the attitude?" Caitlyn asked, "Ok fine, i'm sorry about your phone or whatever, i was justifiably pissed for what you did to me!"

"Justifiably?" Luna blurted out offended, "You so deserved that and so much more for what you did to Chloe!" She almost yelled the last part.

Caitlyn suddenly seemed to have lost her train of thought, she just stood there looking at Luna for a couple of seconds, seemingly lost in her thoughts.

"What?!" Luna finally asked,

She wasn't sure what was going on but she didn't expect Caitlyn's reaction.

Caitlyn lowered her head and mumbled, "You're right, i did deserve that, and so much more."

Suddenly Luna realized it was almost her turn to give her order when the guy at the grill suddenly said that they'll have to wait for a while longer as he started grilling a fresh batch.

She didn't mind as she was completely taken aback with what Caitlyn just said, her whole demeanor was completely out of character.

Luna cooled down and finally asked, "Then why did you do all that to her in the first place?"

".... i don't know" Caitlyn said while mincing her words, "Probably because... i'm an idiot?"

Luna couldn't believe what she was hearing at this point. Caitlyn clearly had a couple of drinks more than she had tonight. As Luna was waiting for the food on the grill she started listening to what Caitlyn had to say, she dropped her guard a little as it seemed she had no actual bad intentions.

Without Luna actually pushing the conversation Caitlyn started talking about her history with Chloe, some stuff Luna already knew, but she was also learning some new stuff.

She had realized before that Chloe never actually talked about her previous school but now she might have an idea why, apparently she went to a prestigious private school where some of the students were from rich families. She could think of a few reasons why she would want to keep that info to herself.

When suddenly Caitlyn asked, "So how did you guys managed to get on this cruise actually? You're with an entire group are you not?"

Luna explained in short how they got into the program thanks to their school, not being sure how the school managed to get in though as it does seem pretty exclusive. Caitlyn seemed to be pleased with this answer, out of basic politeness Luna asked how Caitlyn and her friends managed to get on the cruise.

"Connections," She casually answered and continued with a little smile, "My father is the CEO of one of the sponsoring companies that funded this trip in the first place, so i asked very nicely if i could get a few spots for me and my friends."

Caitlyn had said it in such a casual way as if it wasn't a big deal but now Luna realized she and her family must be rich as fuck, even in a whole other league then Chloe's parents.

"Actually Chloe's dad works for my dad." Caitlyn added, finishing her sentence with taking another sip.

Luna wondered what happened that she was now socializing with what must be her least favorite person on this ship right now, she quickly regained her focus.

"You didn't actually say why you bullied Chloe though, and why do you hate her so much?." Luna answered in a snarky response, "All of that because she confessed her feelings to you? She didn't deserve that!"

"I don't hate her!" Caitlyn spoke up, "It's the exact opposite!"

Luna was confused, especially when Caitlyn suddenly became all embarrassed and shy in front of her.

"When she confessed i... i..." Caitlyn couldn't bring out the words she was looking for, "I had the same feelings as her.... I liked her, still do in fact."

Time stood still for what must have been several seconds before Luna regained her composure, she was speechless, how is this possible. It didn't make sense but her own intuition said Caitlyn wasn't lying. Why the bullying then?

"...I already told you i'm an idiot...." Caitlyn explained while drunkenly mumbling, "I was scared that it would get found out and that kind of relationship just isn't allowed in my family. What if my parents found out. And if other people found out it's only a matter of time until my parents would find out. I don't know what they would do."

"I told a close friend of mine about Chloe's feelings without saying what my own feelings were, she went and spread gossip to everyone else behind my back... I was a coward then and i didn't stop it because i was afraid of being outed."

Caitlyn her head was hanging low by now. Luna her head was spinning, she had so many questions, also why was she saying this now, and why her?

"Why are you telling me this? Why didn't you say this to Chloe? Why now?" Luna asked, "Maybe start with apologizing to her?"

Caitlyn shrugged, "It's too late anyway, she must hate me now. I don't deserve her anyway."

"In fact," Caitlyn quickly added, "I'm glad she found you, don't get me wrong, i hate your guts, but i'm happy for her because she looks happier than ever with you."

"Just... tell her i'm sorry and i promise i won't hurt her no more."

"Why don't you tell her that yourself?!" Luna blurted out.

"Tell herself what?" Chloe suddenly said from behind her,

They hadn't seen Chloe walk up to them from the crowd, she had her eyes locked on Caitlyn. Last time they had stood eye to eye Chloe had been terrified, but right now that old version of her was nowhere to be seen.

"I don't need to hear anything from you, get the fuck away from us!" Chloe said viciously,

"Stop... she came to apologize." Luna pleaded,

Now it was Chloe's turn to look surprised, "What?!"

Caitlyn stood there with her shoulders dropped, she looked too scared to even look in their direction. Chloe must've noticed this completely different attitude coming from Caitlyn as well by now.

Just then the guy at the grill spoke up, telling them their food was ready. Luna quickly took it from him and gave one serving to Chloe who was still perplexed by what was going on.

"I'll let you two talk." Luna said,

And took off.

Just in time as she was bursting to pee, Caitlyn hadn't mentioned anything about the state her clothes were in meaning she was probably ok with the idea of her wetting herself. Now that she was thinking of that, Caitlyn was wearing a dress, for a second she wondered if she was also wetting her panties under her dress. But she felt like it would've been quite a stretch to simply let it flow while talking to her, that would definitely been awkward as hell.

Looking through the crowd she had found where her friends were sitting in one of the lounges, a bit further away from the dance floor, more towards the side of the deck and away from the crowd. Her bladder had already been giving her signs halfway through the conversation that she really needed that release and she realized she was already pretty far in her desperation. She was planning on wetting her pants again when she got away from the crowd and to where her friends were sitting.

Luna started making her way through the crowd, now that she was moving again she got reminded of her soggy panties and jumpsuit, the wet feeling on her skin made it even harder for her to hold it.

She managed to get out of the crowd and now felt the cold night breeze on her skin because she wasn't surrounded by people anymore.

Her bladder immediately gave a spasm and she squirmed on the spot. She could feel tingling in her bladder and knew that this meant she was at her limit... How did she manage to miscalculate her bladder like that...

"Ay caramba!" The same dude with the big ass sombrero jumped in front of her again but did a better job at surprising her this time.

Luna felt a leak escaping, she couldn't believe she had just involuntary leaked in her pants.

The dude immediatly moved on while dancing.

She was trying to hold it but she felt another spurt escaping, adding warmth and fresh wetness in her panties.

Luna knew she was gonna lose control any second now, this was so unlike her, normally her bladder would be able to hold out but it was still sore from all the previous holding and peeing. But what definitely didn't help was the combo of the alcohol, cold wind, wet clothes against her skin and of course the effects of the drug were all having an effect on her bladder.

Normally she would go in full panic mode right about now but instead...

Luna calmly started to walk towards her friends, with each step she took she could feel a spurt escape in her panties. By the time she had done a few steps her crotch was already warming up and she could feel the wetness start to spread down to her thighs.

She couldn't help it, she was peeing herself and she couldn't stop it anymore, the spurts were getting longer with each step until she lost control over her bladder and pee started to pour out and stream down her legs. Warm wetness was spreading everywhere while she was still calmly walking. She had completely given up and was just letting her accident happen while enjoying the sweet relief.

Luna was still midstream when she arrived at the lounge chairs where her friends were sitting, expression of content was plastered on her face while she was still relieving herself in her pants, pee was streaming down her legs while making a puddle at her feet.

"Holy shit Luna, you really needed to go!" Vicky squeeled,

Selena quickly added while laughing, "Did you start peeing yourself from all the way over there?!"

Luna sighed as her stream finally subsided and smiled sheepishly while she said, "I couldn't hold it any longer and it just started coming out from itself."

The others all chuckled, even Peyton and Liv.

"I can't believe i just had an accident though." Luna said carefree.

"It's fine, accidents happen!" Vicky waved it away, "It's allowed after all, remember?"

*132*2023-06-17 22:08

Ok so once again this was getting too long, so the bad news is that... well there's no bad news 😄

The good news is that means you'll probably get another few chapters extra by the time i get to the end of the cruise😄

(There will be some minor time skips at some point)

_____________________________________________

Chapter 23 - "I swear i'm not the jealous type"

Luna was sitting down with the others while she was eating her late night snack. She had a lounge chair for herself, same for Liv and Peyton, while Vicky and Selena were sharing a duo seat lounge bag, the same style as she had been sharing with Chloe on the night she had first kissed her.

The cool touch of her soggy clothes on her skin worked as a naughty reminder of what she had done, not at all embarrassed she had done a full blown accident in her clothes. She even felt a weird kind of pride wetting her clothes on purpose throughout the night.

Chloe wasn't back yet and must still be talking to Caitlyn, she wasn't too far away and when the crowd on the dance floor happened to shift a little bit she had a view on both of them.

Caitlyn still looked like she had no evil intentions and Chloe seemed ok while talking to her.

But Luna felt a bit uneasy about it, she couldn't really place what it was, maybe she was overthinking things again like she usually does.

Liv started a new topic, "Don't you think it's a little bit weird you're all just accepting this... situation? I just can't believe you're purposefully peeing in your clothes, or literally don't care when you have an accident."

"You're starting to sound like a broken record Liv." Selena quickly countered.

"It's no big deal," Luna added her two cents, "It's more convenient to 'go' in your clothes at this point. But you always have a choice to go to the toilet if you want."

"That's good for you i guess, I really wish they would open up some more toilets though." Liv said almost pleading.

Meanwhile Peyton was shifting around in her seat, checking the damage on her shorts once more, which had a visible wet spot on her butt from her earlier squat.

"It's no big deal peyton, really." Vicky said comforting, "Look at us, nobody cares so don't worry too much about it!"

"I guess you're right. Maybe i've been overreacting." Peyton agreed sheepishly,

Liv was overthinking things when she reluctantly said, "Overreacting? I don't know about that, i feel like it's weird that so many people are ok with this?"

"If so many people are ok with it, is it still considered weird then?" Vicky reasoned.

Peyton took another sip from her drink and lit up, "This cruise and party is way too much fun to be worrying about wet pants anyway, and it's still warm outside on top of that."

"That's more like it!" Luna said, trying to go along with this more positive Peyton.

Selena casually added, "Next time you need to pee, don't bother about it and just go in your shorts. I mean they're a little wet anyway."

Luna quickly realised that was one step too far for Peyton, although... Peyton did hesitate for a second before answering.

After hesitating for a second Peyton waved Selena's idea away and shook her head, they quickly started talking about other subjects.

A while later Liv excused herself and left for the toilet again while Peyton was visibly being squirmish but nevertheless stayed and kept sipping from her drink.

"I don't want to get up every time and go through that crowd just to go stand in that long ass line and piss away my night. Pun intended." Peyton said while the rest chuckled and agreed.

With all the drinks they were having, both alcoholic and non alcoholic their bladders were filling up fast.

Luna could already feel her own bladder filling up again at a fast rate, she wasn't worried at all and was already looking forward to rewetting her pants once more.

But it also meant that Peyton must be getting pretty close to desperation levels at this point.

Also they were definitely starting to feel the alcohol by now and Luna could tell everyone was getting more carefree, she guessed Peyton was just gonna pull her shorts to the side and piss on the floor in full view of the others.

Turned out she wasn't wrong, minutes later Peyton spoke up.

"This drug paired with a few drinks is insane! Holy i'm about to piss myself." Peyton blurted out.

She jumped out of her seat and squatted in front of her lounge chair, Atleast with the chairs around her she was getting some cover from the rest of the party.

As expected she was pulling her shorts and panties out of the way in full view of the others. Luna noticed how sloppy she was and saw how Peyton had already started peeing before her panties and shorts were fully out of the way. A fresh wet spot was spreading on her crotch by the time she got her panties and shorts completely to the side. There was no way her panties weren't soaked by now.

While squatting she had her drink In one hand and holding her panties and shorts out of the way with the other. It looked quite challenging to pull that stunt off while keeping your balance through it all... after all she didn't have a hand free to lean on but it looked like Peyton was managing, even with the amount of drinks she already had.

Although... Luna could tell Peyton was being careless, her stream was hitting the floor but some of it was going down to her butt, further wetting the back of her shorts, and it looked like it was a lot more than a few drops this time.

"You're wetting your shorts by the way." Luna said in a carefree demeanor,

Vicky quickly added, "Ah just keep going! It doesn't matter if they get more wet!"

Peyton cursed and immediately shifted, trying to fix her stream so her shorts wouldn't get more wet than they already were. It turned out the drinks were having an effect on her afterall, midstream Peyton started losing her balance. She couldn't use the hand with the drink in so she let go of her shorts and planted her hand down on the floor mid stream to keep her balance.

Her panties and shorts snapped back in place while her stream hit the inside of her panties at full force.

Peyton cursed like a sailor, jumped up and slammed her hand in her crotch, trying to stop her flow. Luna knew how hard it was to stop, just earlier she had experienced an accident of her own afterall.

Selena quickly tried to comfort, "It's no big deal really."

Surprisingly Peyton managed to stop her flow, while still standing she checked the damage on her shorts, her front wasn't too bad considering everything. But then she turned around and Luna could see the big wet patch on her butt that was still glistening with wetness.

Anyone could tell she had peed herself with just a glance from behind.

Peyton was franticly looking around and squirming, it was obvious she was still desperate, after starting to pee it's so much harder to hold after all.

She dropped herself back in squatting position and was trying to get her shorts and panties out of the way while struggling to find her balance. Luna saw how her crotch was starting to glisten with wetness again, drops of pee were already dripping down from her butt and on to the floor.

She was fighting a losing battle.

"It's fine, Just let it happen." Luna said in a comforting whisper.

And Peyton finally gave up, her shoulders dropped and she let out an audible sigh. She moved her hand away to reveal her crotch that showed a quickly expanding wet spot, pee was streaming down from her butt while also pouring out of her pants legs. The wetness was spreading all over her crotch while she stayed in squatting position, emptying her bladder in her shorts.

Although she was having an accident, Luna could see how a small smile formed on Peyton's face. Luna could tell she was enjoying the relief.

The scene unraveling in front of Luna was very different to the one she had experienced at the beginning of the cruise, when Peyton had done an accident in her jeans and made a big scene, back then she had been in tears while trying to hold back her flow desperately.

This was very different, she wasn't fighting it anymore and was letting it happen.

Completely relaxing her bladder and letting it empty in her shorts. Creating a big puddle under her wet stained butt.

When she was finally done (she must've peed in her shorts for at least a minute)

Peyton sheepishly got up, not really knowing what to do now, she looked uneasy at the others. Now that she was done peeing her mind had gone back to reality and came to the full realization she had completely wet her shorts, which were still dripping with pee.

"W-well guess i'm heading to my r-room for tonight guys." Peyton stammered.

There was an uncomfortable silence, the others all knew how Peyton must be feeling right now, they didn't say anything. Except for Luna who spontaneously got up and went to Peyton to stop her from leaving so abruptly.

Something she would normally never do, definitely not with Peyton.

Luna almost whispered in her ear, "Hey don't let your night get ruined by something as trivial as wetting your shorts."

Peyton didn't expect to get comforted like that, especially not by Luna, but she listened.

"Look around you," Luna continued, "So many people including us did the same thing, and literally nobody cared about it."

Peyton looked around a bit and replied, "I guess you're right... but still."

"I have to pee again soon, what do you think i'm gonna do?" Luna now whispered in Peyton's ear.

Peyton rolled her eyes, knowing full well what Luna was hinting about.

"And do you think anyone will care?" Luna said out loud, making her point.

"And lets be real here," Vicky asked carefully, "We could see you enjoyed it."

Peyton didn't say anything, but they could all see her starting to blush, knowing she had in fact enjoyed it. She was struggling with the embarrassment however.

They all sat down again and the whole situation cooled down, Peyton was more quiet than before now but she did stay and listen to the others their conversation. It was cute how she was sitting a little bit hunged over, as if to hide the state her shorts were in. It was adorable Luna thought.

While the others started a conversation, the topic was about how funny it would be if the drug would actually go mainstream in the world and what would the consequences be.

It was a fun topic but Luna couldn't focus. Chloe still wasn't back yet and soon the bad feeling returned. What were those two talking about anyway.

A thought crept in her mind, Chloe had said she used to have feelings for Caitlyn.

What if she still had feelings for her?

Nah there's no way, Luna quickly pushed the thought away. She glanced in their direction again and caught a glimpse of Caitlyn and Chloe. She could see how Caitlyn had said something and Chloe was laughing about it. She seemed to be enjoying herself.

Immediately the bad feeling returned but stronger. Had she made a horrible mistake reintroducing those two?

Caitlyn seemed to come from a rich family, her father was the boss of Chloe's father afterall. She must have a big and beautiful house as well, Luna's small and old house wouldn't even be able to compare to it.

How could Luna ever compete with someone like that? She tried to fight the thoughts, she was sure Chloe would never dump her for someone like Caitlyn.

But what if she still had feelings for her?

Luna snapped out of her deep thoughts when Vicky suddenly announced that she needed to pee.

Peyton was still hunged over, hiding her wet shorts for any person who happened to look in her direction.

"So you're just gonna... let go?" Peyton asked, this time without her usual disapproving attitude.

"Ofcourse." Vicky responded calmly. "My pants are already soaked anyway!"

Peyton asked while sounding a bit worried, "You know there's a whole group there that's about to pass by us right?"

Luna had noticed now as well, a group of party goers were headed their way and were most likely gonna walk right past their table. It didn't seem to bother Vicky, who had already reclined in her duo beanbag next to Selena, spread her legs, with one foot on top of the now empty chair of Liv so everyone now had a perfect view of her pee stained jeans and crotch. And let out a loud sigh.

They could all see how Vicky, without any hesitation or shame, started relieving herself in her pants and seat for anyone to see. Her crotch immediatly got wet and shiny, reflecting the surrounding lights, her pee was flowing down from her crotch and quickly started to pool in the seat and overflow onto the ground.

With an expression of relief on her face, Vicky closed her eyes and leaned slightly backwards resting her head, relishing the moment, comfortably emptying her bladder.

Anyone that would see this would instantly know she was doing it fully on purpose, but she didn't seem to care in the slightest.

Luna was sitting across Vicky and had a perfect view of her friend rewetting her jeans while behind her she could hear the group of party goers that had undoubtedly noticed Vicky by now.

"Guys, are you seeing this?"

"No way she's just going in her pants!"

"Oh she is! Blatantly pissing herself!!"

None of them sounded like they were disgusted by it however, more like intrigued and entertained.

One of the guys nonchalantly asked towards his girlfriend, "Actually, why don't you pee your pants like that? Wouldn't it be way easier for you then to stand in line all day?"

"AcTuAlLy WhY dOn'T yOu PeE yOuR pAnTs LiKe ThAt?!" The girl immediatly fired back.

Their whole group laughed at the guy getting burned like that, The group continued their walk while talking what they had just seen Vicky do.

"I mean all jokes aside, if your pants are already wet anyway, i understand why you wouldn't bother with a toilet anymore." the girl added.

"If you don't mind peeing in your pants if they're already wet, why bother with a toilet in the first place then?" One of the guys asked, trying to poke a hole in the girls logic.

They continued squabbling while they walked outside of hearing distance.

Vicky her stream had subsided by now but not before Luna saw how she pushed a last spurt into her jeans.

"To answer your question Peyton, i don't care if people see it because they're not bothered enough to actually care about it. And neither should you." Vicky answered straight forward.

Selena hadn't said a single word during all this, she was still sitting next to Vicky on the duo beanbag. Luna had remembered that night with Chloe and what that meant for Selena as her face was bright red by now.

Luna was trying to sound as nonchalantly as possible, "These duo lounge bags are really nice huh?"

It was only when Vicky saw Selena's expression she realized what Luna was hinting about.

"Oh my god i'm so sorry! I wasn't thinking, did any get on you? Please say no." Vicky started apologizing profusely.

Peyton was laughing hard, "Oh god no, don't tell me your butt got wet as well by that!"

Selena wasn't getting a word in but sheepishly nodded, affirming what Luna already knew.

Vicky started apologizing even more, she seemed really upset at what she had done.

Luna found the whole thing hilarious and decided to add some more fuel to the fire.

"Maybe you should give her that kiss you promised earlier to make up for what you did!"

Now Peyton suddenly spoke up with a loud "What?!" as she wasn't there when the half drunken promise was made earlier. Once she got filled in what happened she cheered on the idea.

After a few seconds of nervous stalling from Vicky she finally threw her arm around Selena and gave her a peck on the lips, followed by both of them blushing like crazy.

Both Luna and Peyton immediately fired off a "Boooo! that's not really kissing!"

"Wait can you do that again? I missed it!" Chloe suddenly said jokingly,

Luna hadn't noticed it that she had just gotten back to their table, to her dismay Caitlyn was right behind her. Luna didn't know what to think of it, she only knew for sure that she didn't like Caitlyn.

And she had just noticed something, it seemed Caitlyn was very uncomfortable right now.

Chloe quickly added, "I'm just kidding by the way, i saw that sad excuse of a kiss."

"So you two made up your differences?" Selena asked while changing the topic.

"You could say that, i guess." Chloe answered,

Luna was trying to get a read on the situation but couldn't.

Meanwhile Liv their saviour popped up with a plateau full of drinks for them, they were thirsty as hell by now. they all sat down (Liv checked if anyone had sat on her seat in the meantime and checked if it was still dry.) Meanwhile Luna was agitated that Caitlyn also sat down with the others.

Now Luna was sitting next to Chloe and next to her it was Caitlyn.

"Watch out Caitlyn, you better don't do anything weird because Luna can throw you in the pool again!" Vicky joked,

Luna didn't really find it funny, it was a stupid joke if anything. But everyone else was laughing.

The conversation continued with the others wanting to know more about Caitlyn, and the more Luna learned from her the more she got frustrated. It was clear she was no match for her, getting more and more worried about the idea that Chloe could still be into Caitlyn.

What was wrong with her today, this was so unlike her to worry about this, she's normally not the jealous type. Even with her ex Tim, he was the jealous one, not her.

Liv and Peyton downed their drinks and both excused themselves, Peyton probably to go towards her room as it was getting late and she was clearly still embarrassed in her pissy shorts.

On the other hand they saw that Liv had seen their teacher, mr. Davis at one of the bars. And of course she had to go to him.

A little while later, in the middle of a conversation Vicky suddenly spoke up.

"You're peeing aren't you?" Vicky suddenly blurted out.

Luna gave one glance towards Selena and immediately saw her mischievous smile on her face and already knew she was in the middle of peeing herself.

But similar to Selena earlier, Vicky just remained seated although her face got bright red.

They all chuckled knowing what was happening.

"You guys don't seem to worry at all about the drug, and to be more specific, it's effects." Caitlyn said,

"I even dare say we are enjoying it at this point!" Vicky said,

Chloe added, "Well except Peyton and Liv i guess, about that, did Peyton pee her shorts in the end? I saw the stain on her butt when she left."

They quickly brought Chloe up to speed what had happened and the conversation carried on for a little longer. Luna hadn't barely said a word yet.

During this time Caitlyn was sometimes squirming a little in her seat and the others had noticed.

Caitlyn got up and announced she was gonna leave, as the night had been long enough and she had enough to drink up until now.

"You don't have to leave if you need to pee, no need to be embarrassed about it!" Selena mentioned.

"I wish my friends were as easy going as you guys are really. But no i'm leaving anyway."

Caitlyn quickly added with a grin, "And i'll be honest, i was intending on rewetting my panties soon anyway."

Before she left she gave one more apology to everyone, especially Chloe and Luna. Luna didn't know how to feel about it. At least now that she was leaving Luna felt herself less agitated.

Luna felt like she was overreacting about this and was trying to ignore her sudden bad self esteem, she couldn't let it ruin her night, or worse, it might create tension in her still very early relationship with Chloe. It should be obvious that Chloe wouldn't want anything to do with Caitlyn after everything that she had done...

On top of that, It was just the four of them now so she didn't need to worry.

What's more important right now though, is that she needed to pee, and so far she had only peed while standing which meant her butt was still mostly dry.

It was time to change that and further enjoy her night, after seeing what Vicky had done earlier Luna felt no shame for doing this, but her heart rate was already going up just thinking about it.

While the others were in the middle of a conversation without saying anything Luna reclined in her seat, spread her legs and relaxed her bladder to start flooding her jumpsuit and seat.

She wasn't holding back and quickly she could see her pee starting to pool and overflow off of the front of the seat. Meanwhile she could feel the wet warmth spread and creep up her butt. She loved the feeling and was enjoying it to it's fullest, relishing the moment.

She could feel how her clothes were getting more soaked than before and she loved every bit of it.

Vicky nonchalantly asked, "When she's done peeing, lets check out the bar and go somewhere else? i'm getting thirsty again."

They all agreed while Luna replied with a simple "I'm almost done."

"Man i wish we were sitting in that duo lounge bag right now." Chloe said boldly,

They all chuckled at Chloe while they all seemed to find it perfectly normal that Luna was peeing herself.

Luna loved everything about this, she was simply 'going' in her pants once again without a care and everyone around her was ok with that, she was in heaven.

"I'm done, lets go."

The moment Luna her stream subsided she got up while still dripping with pee.

Realised there was still some more and pushed out another spurt that went into her panties, dribbling it's way down her legs. She left a big puddle behind on the seat that was slowly getting sucked into the cushion to eventually disappear and dry up in a couple of minutes.

They all quickly downed their drinks and decided to go for another round but go to the bar together and go hang around on the deck somewhere else, more further into the party.

________________

"Did you notice they closed off the one remaining toilet again?" Chloe asked,

In fact, they hadn't noticed, what they did quickly notice while walking around the deck in search for the bar, was the large amount of people that did have wet pants, especially when they went further away from where the last remaining toilet was and away from secluded pee spots. Women and some men had wet pee stains on their clothes.

So many in fact, Luna felt like they weren't even standing out anymore at all with their peed pants.

Luna could swear there were more girls with wet pants than without by now.

She glanced at the dance floor trying to get and idea on how many still had dry pants, and as she was staring she could see how there was a girl dancing in the middle, minding her own business while her pants where all shiny from wetness, it was so obvious she was peeing herself and she didn't hide it at all.

Luna had a hard time looking away from it, when the women was finally done peeing she saw another girl with a skirt that had pee streaming down her legs while she was in a conversation with other people.

Luna was baffled by the scenes that were happening around her.

The bar they went to was close to a pool and while they were waiting for their drinks they all got their attention drawn to what was happening on the other side of the pool.

Two girls were sitting on the side of the pool with their feet dangling in the water, one was wearing a short dress and the other was wearing tight but sexy black jeans shorts.

The thing was, they could see pee streaming down from the crotch of the girl in black shorts while they were glistening from wetness, the other girl her dress had pee streaming out and through it and into the water.

They were both wetting themselves and letting it run into the pool while nonchalantly in a conversation with each other.

"Holy shit, are you seeing this?" Luna blurted out,

The others quickly agreed, it was clear people had switched their toilet habits, or rather the lack there of in a higher gear.

While they were standing at the bar another girl came walking up to what must be a friend of hers that was also waiting for drinks. Both had clearly wet their pants before.

________________________

"Oh there you are! Thought i'd lost you!"

The girls started a conversation next to Luna's group but they could hear what they were talking about.

"Oh you had an accident? Or was it on purpose? No need to be embarrassed about it!"

"Well... You know how it goes, do you also feel how you've been standing in line for the toilet like... forever!"

"Oh yea absolutely."

"So yea... I knew i had to leave to go stand in line or else i'd wet myself, but i was having too much fun and suddenly realised i waited for too long."

"Haha same actually, because of that i pissed myself like an hour ago already!"

"You know what, in all honesty, i could probably have made it, but then i noticed how many people around me had actually already gone in their pants and i just said fuck it."

"Yep, i went in my pants several times already, probably again soon because i have to pee again."

_________________________

Luna and the group were all slightly chuckling at what they were hearing while eaves dropping.

Just then they got their drinks they ordered and Vicky suddenly wanted to make a toast.

"I think it's time to make it official!" Vicky started,

The others weren't sure what she was talking about although Luna had a vague idea.

Vicky continued, "Al though it's probably the alcohol talking right now!"

Luna was pretty sure about that, although to be fair, they were all starting to get drunk by now.

"But in all seriousness," Vicky declared, "We already know we all enjoy it so i'm just gonna say it, from now on we should just go in our pants whenever we feel like it!"

"umm, aren't we already doing that?" Selena asked sheepishly.

Vicky rolled her eyes, "Yea sure, on the party when drunk, but then tomorrow we chicken out again or something."

Vicky quickly took another sip and lifted her drink in the air, "There's a good chance i might skip the toilet tomorrow if i feel like it!

"aaah"

They all chuckled at this weird but funny toast, they all agreed and cheered back with their fresh drinks in their hand. This was something Luna had always dreamed of, with each passing day her fetish basicly was becoming more and more normal and she loved it.

"If i hadn't wet my pants earlier i would've done it right now, to make it official so to speak" Selena joked.

Chloe had taken a sip from her drink before she spoke up, "I need to pee actually, but i was gonna wait until we would go to a less crowded place and...."

Vicky waved it away, "Just do it right here, it's fine!"

Selena and Luna cheered her on.

Of course if her friends and girlfriend were cheering her on... how could she refuse?

They were standing in the middle of the crowd when Chloe took a sip from her drink, spread her feet apart, relaxed and emptied her bladder right then and there where she was standing while the others were playfully cheering her on.

Chapter 24 - "What did we get ourselves into?"

As the party continued they were all getting pretty drunk by now, but hey! They were all having a good time while hanging around the bar.

Even though right now Luna still had a bad feeling, wondering if Chloe still had feelings for Caitlyn. She tried to shake the thought off.

"Hey you two!" Chloe suddenly shouted, "When are you actually gonna make out with each other?"

Both Selena and Vicky stuck their tongue out.

"Boooo! Give us a show!" Chloe joked,

They carried on talking about a new topic while Luna was eaves dropping what was being said behind her.

She had noticed a group behind her, two girls, probably friends of each other and their boyfriends (Luna assumed) had mentioned they needed to pee and had wandered off somewhere probably to find a spot to relieve themselves. Leaving the girls who were quite desperate Luna quickly learned.

They both still had dry pants Luna noticed, which was getting increasingly less common now that the toilets were closed.

"I need to pee so bad!" The girl loudly declared.

Her friend replied slightly irritated, "I told you we should've gone to our rooms the moment we noticed the toilets all closed!"

"I didn't want to go yet, we've been standing in line for the toilet all night. I just want to enjoy myself and not have to care about going to the toilet all the time!"

"And look where that got us! I need to pee really bad as well and i don't want to have an accident, so what's the plan?"

"Well honestly... i've been thinking about it, the plan.... listen."

Luna just now realized these girls were pretty drunk as well.

"The plan is..." The girl said while letting out chuckles, "I'm thinking of just having an accident."

"What the fuck, are you crazy?!"

"I mean look around us, did you see the group behind us? Those girls have all peed themselves, probably multiple times even. Why even care at this point?"

"You're joking right!?" The girl blurted out, not believing what her friend was saying, "This isn't the time for jokes, i seriously need to pee bad."

Knowing people were noticing their pee soaked pants made Luna blush, she glanced over to the two girls. Both were clearly squirmish with one girl already having her hands between her legs trying to hold in her pee.

The girls continued to squabble and argue but Luna had a hard time hearing it over the loud music that was playing. When after a little while she could pick up again what they were saying.

"Fuck it, I'm just gonna do it, i need to pee so bad!"

"No, don't!"

After a short pause the girl let out a gasp, "...Oh god I'm peeing."

Luna could hear the other girl gasp as well.

She quickly glanced behind her to catch the girl in the middle of peeing her stylish black shorts. Slightly with her legs parted, pee was pouring down from her shorts legs and some was flowing down her legs and in her fashion boots.

"I can't believe you're peeing yourself like that..."

"Oh... it kinda feels good..." The girl said while starting to giggle,

She readjusted her stance and put her feet wider to try and spare her boots from getting any wetter. This made it even more obvious what she was doing and drew the attention of the rest of Luna's group.

With pee still pouring out of the girls shorts legs Vicky spoke up and raised her glass.

"Just let it flow girl!"

The girls friend had her hand in front of her mouth from sheer shock while her face was flustered from the shame seeing her friend wet her shorts like that in the middle of the party.

On the other hand, the girl who was peeing herself didn't seem to care all too much.

When she was finally done peeing (which lasted for well over a minute) she let out a long "aaaaah" and changed back to her normal stance, standing in her puddle.

"Damn that kinda felt good! Can't believe i did that!" Meanwhile she was checking the damage on her shorts (which were soaked) while she jokingly mentions, "Now it's your turn, you'll feel a lot better."

Luna and her group all chuckled at the girl and how she was trying to convince her friend from doing the same, while they squabbled in the background it was clear her friend wasn't having it though, seconds later she had bolted away towards the entrance of the ship, probably hoping she would find a toilet before having an accident.

_________________________________________

Luna and the others had all peed in their pants several times by now and it definitely showed, anyone who would look in their direction could see they had peed themselves at least once.

You would think that would make them less inclined to go and talk to strangers but that didn't stop Selena and Vicky to try and score with some guys, or at least it looked like they were about to try when they started socializing with two guys at the bar, leaving Luna and Chloe on their own.

Chloe grabbed Luna's hand and led her further away from the bar and the others, they got to the side of the pool when Chloe turned around and looked at Luna, who was wondering what this was about.

"Everything okay?" Chloe suddenly asked, "Earlier you were like a ball of energy and now you're barely saying anything."

"uuhm"

Shit, Chloe had noticed...

"Did i do or say something wrong?" Chloe asked worried.

"N-no no, it's just...." Luna didn't know what to say.

After an uncomfortable silence between them something else grabbed their attention.

Something was going on on the other side of the pool they were standing next to. They weren't sure what suddenly happened but it seemed a few guy's had caught a girl by surprise and thrown her into the pool, she tumbled in the water screaming while making a big splash. Causing a hilarious scene.

A few seconds later her head popped back up out of the water and immediately gave the guys her middle finger. People that were standing around the pool were laughing their asses off at the prank.

"What? You pissed your pants earlier anyway, it's just a little bit more wetness." The guy said as an excuse while shrugging.

The girl immediately shouted back, "No i didn't!"

"Yes you did!" Several of the people who must be her friends immediately called her out.

The girl replied smug with an evil grin, "I'm completely soaked, so even if i did you don't have any proof!"

"Bitch the pee stain on your pants was bigger than mine!" One of the girls on the side yelled, pointing towards her own clearly peed pants.

Their entire group was laughing over this including the soaked girl in the pool.

Luna and Chloe were laughing as well when Luna turned her attention back to Chloe,

"It's nothing to worry about really." Luna lied,

Chloe got a grin on her face when she replied, "You know you're a terrible liar right?"

Luna immediately lowered her head and started to blush. This wasn't the first time someone told her she was terrible at lying.

"Hey you can tell me anything," Chloe said softly, almost whispering, "Is this maybe about Caitlyn?"

Luna now got even more flustered, fumbling with her now empty drink still in her hand.

A grin came over Chloe's face, "You're not gonna tell me you're jealous right?"

"....maybe." Luna felt her face getting bright red, when she was hearing it out loud coming from her own mouth she felt even more ashamed.

Chloe started laughing.

"Is it that funny?" Luna asked confused.

"Kind of," Chloe answered still chuckling, "Caitlyn said exactly the same, as in she being jealous about you!"

"Wait really?" Luna was caught off guard by that surprise,

"Of course, Isn't it obvious obvious why?" Chloe asked, paused and thought of what to say next, "Honestly i really didn't see it coming, her confession i mean. Hearing those words coming out of her mouth...that she has feelings for me."

Chloe shook her head, "Whatever... it doesn't matter, i don't get why you would be jealous over her though?"

Luna felt incredibly uncomfortable, but she was already this far so she had to ask it.

"Do you still have feelings for her?"

"After everything she did? Of course not!" Chloe started laughing again, "Wait that's what you were worried about?"

Luna sheepishly nodded, partly relieved but also left feeling silly.

"I just thought... she's probably rich as fuck, probably has a fancy house and car. You know... how can i compete with that? Compared to me...i'm not like that, look at my house for example." Luna took a deep breath, "And i remember you saying you had feelings for her in the past."

"Uhm...i don't care about any of that!" Chloe immediately blurted out, "Wait, what's wrong with your house?"

Luna was once again caught off guard.

"Compared to your house, which is also... just so amazing it's... intimidating." Luna almost mumbled the words out.

The puzzle pieces all fell together for Chloe now, realizing what was bothering Luna for a long time already.

"Oh... oooh! i'm so sorry, i had no idea you felt like that!" Chloe said apologetically and then continued with her trademark smile on her face. "So that's why you were apprehensive about me coming over! Actually i always wished you would invite me over more, i like it at your place, it's all warm and cozy!"

Luna realized she had been way overthinking things once again...Chloe didn't care one bit about the difference between them. "I'm an idiot..." she thought

Chloe suddenly took a step closer to Luna, grabbing her hands. "Fuck Caitlyn, she won't ever be my friend again anyway, let alone having feelings for her."

Luna felt all warm and fuzzy on the inside, she believed Chloe completely and knew she had worried for nothing. But what Chloe was about to say still surprised her.

"You're the one i love."

Luna's eyes widened and looked at Chloe in surprise, speechless in the moment.

"uhm, sorry, maybe i said too much?" Chloe said while getting all flustered.

"N-no no, it's okay!" Luna blurted out,

Now it was Chloe's turn to become all flustered, Luna thought it was hella cute.

"Hey do you guys have anything on you that can't get wet? Like you're phones are waterproof right?" Selena suddenly asked, popping up seemingly out of nowhere and not realizing Luna and Chloe were having a moment.

"uhm... no? Wait why?"

Vicky suddenly popped out from behind Selena surprising both of them and before they could reacted they both pushed Luna and Chloe with all their might.

They both had realized it a split second too late and got surprised, there was nothing they could do to stop this anymore and landed with a big splash into the pool followed by applause from onlookers. This triggered something with the onlookers... some of the other people started to push their own friends into the pool and very quickly it became chaos.

Luna moved her now wet hair out of her eyes to get greeted with a just as wet Chloe in front of her. They were both until their shoulders in the water, their hair was dripping, clothes soaked, making Chloe's white blouse semi transparent and revealing her bra she was wearing underneath while some of her make up had ran out.

At the same time they both let out a "fuck!"

The night sky, paired with the pool being lit, made Chloe somehow look even more attractive than she already was. Even with some of her make up that had ran out.

Chloe was getting visibly shy, "Um, about what i said, you don't have to respond if you..."

"Shut up." Luna said while a smile came on her face.

She moved closer to Chloe, took her in an embrace and right before she started to kiss her she whispered, "I love you too."

They completely ignored the chaos that was happening around them in the pool as they only had attention for each other and everything else faded out.

__________________________

Two guys were making their way through the crowd, there was a bunch of commotion around the pool. It became clear some people where jumping in the pool or something, it didn't matter as they were heading back to their room, it was late and they had enough for today. When suddenly his friend punched him on his shoulder.

"Dude wtf?"

"Duuuuuude!"

"What?!"

"Look in the pool! It's Chloe and Luna!!"

"Oh... oooh shit!"

The friends were looking from the side of the pool, seeing their two fellow classmates entangled in a steamy make out session.

They saw how Vicky and Selena jumped in the pool as well with clothes and everything, to then splash water in the direction of Chloe and Luna and shouted at them.

"Hey lovebirds! Go get a room!"

"Yea, go make love somewhere else!"

They didn't seem to mind the teasing, they both flipped off Selena and Vicky and continued kissing. Not at all aware there were two classmates looking.

"Duuuuude! Are They actually dating?"

"What else did it look like?"

"What do you think the others would say?"

"What do you think Tim, Luna's ex would say?!"

The two guys continued their walk to their room while discussing what they just saw.

_______________________________________________________

When they all got out of the pool a little later they immediately noticed what a bad idea that actually was, with the soaked clothes out of the pool it was ice cold in the chilly night air.

They made their way through the party soaking wet, thinking about what their next move would be, but they quickly saw their opportunity when passing by the hottub, only one guy was in there with two girls, they didn't mind getting in with them as they had enough room in there for all of them.

Only once they got in the hottub Luna recognized them, it was the tall bald black guy with the muscled body that they met a few days ago at the pool. He was in there with his girlfriend on his side and the other girl on his other side must be a friend Luna thought.

With his typical deep and rumbling voice he asked, "Hey girls, enjoying the party?"

They all eagerly said yes, he seemed really friendly. After all they remembered how he had stood up for them with the Karen at the beginning of the cruise.

Soon after they had managed to get their hands on a fresh rounds of drinks when they ordered from an employee with a cart rolling around. All meanwhile Luna and Chloe still had a silly grin on their face from what had happened earlier in the pool.

They were all sitting in the hottub fully clothed, same for the other three they didn't know the name of.

They were all getting pretty drunk by now, especially Vicky and Selena, but who cares? After all they were on vacation and they could just walk to their room at any given time.

Luna took another sip from her drink, warm and comfortably with Chloe in her embrace, enjoying the hottub, enjoying her night to it's fullest while she didn't have to worry about Caitlyn anymore.

Meanwhile the guy blatantly started to make out with his girlfriend, which was slightly awkward as they were all sitting pretty close to each other and they were strangers to them. Although it didn't really bother them too much, on top of that Chloe was having her own ideas it seemed.

While relaxing and enjoying the hottub Luna could feel how Chloe was making advances onto her, her hands were obscured from view in the hottub because of the bubbles and foam on top of the water but she could feel Chloe's hands going over her thighs and Luna was loving it.

If those two were making out, would it be fine if she would kiss Chloe right now?

As she was wondering about it she noticed something while glancing over at the trio.

The guy was making out with his girlfriend on one side, while she seemed to have her hand on his... lap? She wasn't sure what she was doing as it got obscured by the layer of foam on top of the water.

Hold up... with another glance she saw how the guy had one arm around his girlfriend, but noticed his other hand was going down to the other girls lap... whatever he was doing was hidden by the layer of foam. Luna's attention peeked, what was happening under that layer of foam?

Meanwhile Selena and Vicky were talking about how the guys they met at the bar had been obnoxious losers that thought they were way too cool for this party, so instead of sticking with them they quickly bailed and decided to go and play a prank and throw Luna and Chloe into the pool as a prank.

"Fuck you very much for that!" Luna said jokingly,

"You're welcome!"

Luna glanced over to the trio again and she could see how the girl on the side was slightly rocking back and forth with a dreamy look on her face, slightly with her mouth open. If she didn't know any better, she would swear the guy next to her was...

Before Luna could finish her thought Chloe had started on her next advance, Luna couldn't refuse and a second later they were kissing. Being drunk and horny at this point because of what was happening in the hottub next to them. Kissing quickly turned into making out as they got more and more into it.

"Oh you girls are having a good time as well, i can tell!" The girl on the side said in a dreamy voice, "I'm Chanel by the way."

The couple briefly paused their make out session to introduce themselves, "I'm Vanessa and this is my boyfriend Zeke ('Whassup')"

Luna and Chloe paused their make out session, while being shy they all introduced themselves and Chloe confirmed, "Yea we're enjoying ourselves! What about you guys?"

This whole situation was kind of odd Luna thought, and this trio was so casual about it.

Zeke answered with a grin, "Oh we're having a great time, don't mind us ok, we're just having some fun over here."

Wait what exactly did he mean by that? Luna was suspicious to what exactly was happening below the water surface. Meanwhile Chloe didn't seem to care as much and had moved on to kissing Luna in her neck, working her way to her earlobes. Luna was having a hard time keeping attention to what the trio was doing while she was getting more and more turned on by Chloe her advances.

"Oh, ok i see, uhm, ok." Vicky and Selena stammered,

Luna had lost her attention for a few seconds but when she glanced to the trio again she started to question things even more.

Zeke's girlfriend, Vanessa was leaning over him and was now kissing Chanel full on the mouth.

Hold on what kind of relationship did these three people exactly have?? Although... Luna couldn't deny she liked what she was seeing as both these women were really attractive.

Selena and Vicky glanced at each other, thinking "What did we get ourselves into?"

Now Zeke started making out with Chanel, leaving his girlfriend on his side, but meanwhile Luna could swear... obscured by the foam on the water... she could swear... Was his hand in Vanessa's pants while making out with Chanel?!

Suddenly Vanessa let out a moan, confirming what Luna was thinking.

Zeke interrupted his kiss with Chanel for a brief moment and turned around to his girlfriend and said in a deep voice, "Oh you sound like you're enjoying yourself."

Vanessa let out another moan, confirming what Zeke had just said. On top of that, even if it was mostly obscured by the water, they could now all see how Vanessa started to move her hips back and forth.

Selena's eyes widened in shock, Vicky her mouth was hanging open from sheer disbelieve, Chloe stopped and looked up, stunned. They were all speechless at the scene in front of them, realizing Zeke was in the middle of fingering his girlfriend while making out with the other girl.

Vicky was the first to speak. "Holy shit!"

Zeke had realized the others shocked expressions, "I'm sorry about that, want us to stop?"

Before they could even respond...

"No." Vanessa said in between moans, "Don't stop."

"Uhm... N-no it's fine." Luna stammered while the others nodded sheepishly.

This was totally bonkers but so... so hot.

And it's not like they were doing anything inherently wrong.

They sat in awe as they saw how Zeke fingered his girlfriend to an orgasm, Vanessa moaned loud while they could all see how spasms were going through her.

Now it was Selena's turn to say, "Holy shit!"

Luna her heart was beating like crazy, she was all flustered by what had just happened in front of her, she frantically looked around outside the hottub to see if people had noticed, but with all the loud music and people partying it seemed like nobody was paying any attention to what was happening here in the hottub, most of it hidden by only a thin layer of foam while most of the sound they made got muffled by the music.

"Screw it." Luna thought, nobody was paying attention to them anyway, she pulled Chloe closer to her and they started making out, more passionate than before. Obscured by the foam Luna slid her hands over Chloe's thighs, feeling her leggings and riding her hand upwards inside her shorts legs. Luna could feel Chloe's mouth open and she immediately accepted and let her tongue slide in, followed by small moans by both.

This situation was crazy right now but she couldn't stop, she had never felt anything like this, she shouldn't do it but she got so aroused that she wasn't thinking anymore.

Soon Luna and Chloe's attention got drawn to the trio again when now they could hear moans coming from them again. Luna couldn't believe what she was seeing, seriously what is their relationship exactly?!

The trio had shifted places (Luna and Chloe had been so occupied they hadn't even noticed yet) Chanel was now sitting in the middle with Zeke now chilling on their side, with a bottle of beer in one hand and his arm draped around Chanel's shoulders, with one hand in her soaked top, fondling her boobs.

Meanwhile Vanessa was on the other side of Chanel, even if it was obscured by the foam Luna was sure of it, she was making out and simultaneously fingering Chanel while she was letting out moans.

"So let me get this straight, your girlfriend there is doing your friend, while you're playing with her boobs?" Selena said in disbelief while Vicky still hadn't closed her mouth from the shock.

Zeke took a sip from his beer and confirmed with a grin, "mhm." He then nods at Chanel, "And you probably didn't catch the part where she's also jacking me off."

This was completely insane, but Luna couldn't help getting more and more turned on by it all. Luna now faced Chloe, with simply looking in her eyes she already knew what she wanted, what they both wanted at the moment. She wanted to do her right here and now. Underwater Luna unbuttoned Chloe's shorts while she could already feel her spread her legs, inviting Luna, she slid her hand down in her shorts and panties and let her fingers gently caress and explore Chloe's pussy. They continued kissing, followed by occasional moans coming from Chloe.

Luna started playing with Chloe's clit, loving how she could feel her squirm with every touch, moan with every tease, they completely lost attention to their surroundings and were completely going up in their love making. Luna slid a finger inside, fingering Chloe underwater while nobody could directly see what they were doing,

...In the hottub.

In the middle of a party on the top deck....

Vicky and Selena glanced at each other once again, both with a look of shock on their face.

On one side of the hottub there was basically a threesome going on, while on the other side they had their two friends, they couldn't be completely sure what was going on because of the water with a layer of foam on top, but they didn't know any better than that Luna was in the middle of fingering Chloe, and from the look on Chloe's face and her moaning she wasn't all that far off of climaxing.

Both didn't immediately want to accept it, but they were seriously turned on by everything happening around them.

Chanel was letting out moans of pleasure, getting closer to her own climax with the help of Vanessa next to her,

Zeke encouraged them on in between sips from his beer, "Come on babe, she's about to come!"

Zeke now turned towards Selena and Vicky and asked in his typical deep voice.

"What's up with you two, don't fancy making love?" Zeke said with his deep but gentle voice.

"Uhm sorry, kinda drunk but still straight." Vicky said,

Selena suddenly blurted out drunkenly, "Maybe bi."

"Wait really?" Vicky suddenly asked shocked at this revelation.

Selena's face instantly turned red and was in shock, realising she had said that out loud.

Vicky couldn't help but chuckle, "It's okay, not gonna lie, but i already had some suspicions."

Zeke nodded towards his companions next to him and joked, "Don't worry, they're also straight, well kind of, does it really matter? Don't be scared, relax and just enjoy yourselves."

Those words left Vicky conflicted, she was sure of herself being straight, but it was hard for her to deny she was getting aroused from seeing girls around her make love to each other. Vicky's resistance was starting to show cracks, on top of that Selena was now looking at her with this weird expression on her face... suddenly she started to lean towards her.

Vicky felt herself leaning in as well, their lips met, one kiss quickly became two and soon she could feel herself melt, experiencing the softness and tenderness that came with kissing another girl surprised her, realising she was kind of enjoying it.

Chloe arced her back and let out a load moan. pure pleasure was coursing through her body as she climaxed while Luna felt Chloe's pussy convulsing. She took her hand out and observed how Chloe was still shaking from her orgasm seconds later.

They both slowly came down from their high and back to reality, just in time to see Chanel orgasm as well while letting out loud moans.

"Nice!" Zeke's voice rumbled.

In all their horniness they had completely forgotten about their surroundings, to Luna and Chloe's surprise when they looked to the other side of the hottub they were now greeted with the sight of Selena and Vicky who where in the middle of a steamy make out session. With tongue and everything.

All of this was surreal, how in the world had they all gone this far.

Now she frantically started to look around and noticed the party was steadily declining and people were leaving, but to her horror she quickly noticed a lot of people were now looking in their direction, shit...

Luna quickly whispered in Chloe's ear, who was still recovering from her orgasm. "Shit, we might have overdone it, everyone's staring at us."

"Holy shit Luna," Chloe said in a dreamy voice, "Your fingers are AMAZING!"

"Omg get your shit together!"

"Hahaha," Zeke was just laughing at them, looked like he was having a good time, "Relax, those people are just jealous, that's all!"

Suddenly Vanessa swapped places again with Zeke, putting him back in the middle, Vanessa said in a buttery smooth voice, "It's your turn baby!"

Did these people have no shame at all?? Luna poked at Vicky and Selena's feet and legs and got their attention,

"Time to go, you can continue later in your room!" Luna said and got up from the hottub.

"Huh what?" Selena stammered,

"W-we were just, uhm, i'm not, we're just drunk ok!" Vicky stammered and slurred together an excuse.

"Whatever, get up!"

They quickly said their goodbyes to the trio and got out of the hottub.

"Hope you had fun girls!" Chanel waved and winked,

"Just when the real fun was starting! Nah just joking!" Zeke shouted, "Cya!"

Vanessa also said her goodbye, even though it was obscured by the bubbles and foam layer on top of the water they could all tell she was already working her magic on Zeke's dick.

With dripping wet clothes they quickly made their way across the top deck, aware of all the staring eyes that were looking in their direction. Luna felt beyond embarrassed, this was way too much attention for her liking. Chloe had her arms crossed, trying to hide her wet see through white blouse that was showcasing her bra.

While passing a group of guys they could all hear them shouting stuff.

"Yea girls, now that's how you party!"

"Hot!!"

"Don't leave yet!!"

"Why didn't you keep going?!!"

They got to the door to enter inside the ship and Selena and Vicky shouted, "Oh god what have we done!"

At least the cold was making them sober up, but that wasn't helping the situation at all.

_________________________________

"Fuck!" They were almost at their room, ice cold and soaked from head to toes.

Vicky and Selena headed to their own room while Luna was trying to open their door, she was shivering so hard from the cold that she struggled for a few seconds to open the mechanism.

Once inside she kicked off her soaking wet shoes and before she even could do anything else she could feel Chloe opening the zipper of her jumpsuit on her back,

Chloe whispered from behind, "Let me help you warm back up."

They helped each other out of their wet clothes, her jumpsuit was already laying on the ground while she started to unbutton and remove Chloe's soaked blouse. After that she unbuttoned her shorts and started to pull them down, revealing Chloe's light blue panties, meanwhile Chloe was playing with her hands in Luna's wet hair, waiting for her girlfriend to strip her off her wet clothes. She helped a bit more by unclipping Luna's bra while she was taking of her shorts, soon after her own bra came off.

By the time Chloe pushed Luna on their bed, both of them were only wearing their soggy panties anymore. Chloe crawled on top of Luna and slowly pulled off her panties while Luna let her do, laying completely naked on bed she quickly pulled Chloe in an embrace.

They were caressing each other, experiencing each other for the first time while exploring each others bodies. Luna enjoyed the kisses that Chloe was giving on her skin all over her body, followed by her sucking on Luna's nipples. It was just them and nothing else that mattered in this very moment.

Chloe lifted herself and Luna saw her chance and shoved her hand into Chloe's panties, further exploring Chloe's pussy, continuing where they had left off in the hottub. She loved how soaking wet her pussy already was, hold on, as she was caressing her pussy she could start to feel even more wetness. A second later something warm was running through her fingers, dribbling down from Chloe as she started peeing her panties. It dripped all over Luna's stomach, running down and wetting their bed.

Luna was in heaven, the dribble quickly turned into a stream and she could feel it jet against her hand. The bed sheets below and around her were starting to get soaking wet as more and more pee cascaded down from Chloe's crotch onto Luna.

Luna knew she wasn't gonna last long as they continued playing in their already wet bed, Chloe was playing with Luna's clit while they were making out, starting to finger her and Luna could already feel her orgasm coming any second from now, she knew she was gonna lose control over her bursting bladder any moment now.

Chloe started rubbing Luna's clit as fast as she could and Moments later pure feeling of ecstacy ran through Luna, her back arced, moaning loudly. Pee sprayed out of her and against Chloe's hand, redirecting and splashing pee everywhere. The bed got thoroughly soaked but neither of the girls cared. In fact they enjoyed it even. Chloe came laying next to her in the wet bed while Luna was still heavily panting, trying to catch her breath. She never knew sex could be this heavenly.

Chloe was curling up to Luna, caressing her breasts while she was coming down from her high.

They were looking into each others eyes when they both got a giant smile on their face, when Luna brought up the promise from earlier in the day, before the party.

"Remember i was gonna make it up to you for earlier?" Luna asked,

"mhm," Chloe said, "Wait, wasn't that the thing in the hottub?"

"Oh no, that wasn't it!" Luna said while she lifted herself up and got on top of Chloe.

Luna gave a quick kiss on Chloe's mouth and started to make her way down, kissing her neck, nipples, stomach... Luna grabbed Chloe's soggy peed panties and pulled them off, Chloe answered by spreading her legs wide, giving a magnificent view to Luna.

"Oh Luna... holy fuck..."

Luna kissed her thigh, and after a short pause she started kissing Chloe around her crotch area, teasing her, she could feel how her girlfriend was almost losing it from anticipation.

At last Luna let her tongue slide over her pussy and in her slit, caressing her clit. Kissing and sucking it, and with every other move she did Luna could feel Chloe squirm and moan.

Juices were freely flowing out of Chloe's pussy while Luna could taste her, the slight after taste of pee was pushing her arousal even further.

"Luna s-stop, i'm gonna come!"

Luna didn't stop, in fact she started sucking even harder, mixed with licking Chloe's clit. Luna could feel Chloe pussy convulse around her tongue while seeing spasms going through her, only then Luna stopped eating her out and started rubbing her pussy as hard as she could while Chloe was moaning loudly, loud enough that the neighbours could definitely hear it but neither of the girls couldn't care less at this point. Chloe squirted all over Luna and the bed, soaking everything even more than it already was.

"Oh my fucking god Luna!"

Then came the aftermath. Luna was dripping wet, she was sitting on her knees in bed, in front of a naked Chloe that was still panting, basking in the afterglow of her orgasm. Luna slowly crawled next to Chloe, wanting to cuddle her. Giving her small kisses, she couldn't really describe it but she felt like something special had just happened between them. They cuddled in their wet bed for a little while longer, thinking that the night was coming at it's end.

Luna had no idea sex could be this great, not that her ex Tim was bad... it was just... he never even ate her pussy out, something she was eager to experience to know how it would feel.

Chloe suddenly lifted herself up from Luna's embrace as Luna wondered what she was up to.

"Huh, what are you doing?" Luna asked confused.

Chloe had a mischievous grin on her face, "The thing with lesbian sex, is that it's only over when both say it's over!"

Chloe made her way down and before Luna could prepare herself, she could feel Chloe starting to lick her pussy, starting to eat her out.

"Ooooh!"

When her orgasm came crashing down on her minutes later, her mind went blank and Luna learned it felt even better than she had hoped it would.

She moaned loudly, almost yelling while squirting all over Chloe, giving their bed another good soaking.

When the afterglow finally faded and Chloe had crawled herself back next to her it was clear they were both done for the night, immediately falling asleep in each other's embrace.

They were so tired and exhausted neither woke up in the middle of the night when they needed to pee, both wetting the bed in their sleep.

Chapter 25

Pain...

Head ache to be more exact.

Was the first thing that Luna felt, her head was throbbing.

The light that came through the curtains felt way too bright and hurt her eyes, she turned around so she didn't have to look at the light.

Now she was facing Chloe who looked like she was still out cold, drooling on her pillow.

Luna started to fully wake up, recalling what had happened last night while she also noticed the pressure on her bladder, she needed to pee pretty bad.

It's only now that she remembered she was fully naked under the blankets, and so was Chloe who was laying right next to her.

She started blushing heavily when thinking back of last night, she could still recall the taste and texture of Chloe's pussy while eating her out, making her orgasm. Now without the effects of all the alcohol paired with the lack of horniness she felt some embarrassment about it.

She was reminiscing her mind shattering orgasm from getting her pussy eaten out, she had never experienced anything like it although she couldn't remember what had happened right after that, she must've fallen asleep instantly she figured.

She was letting her hand go over the sheets, surprisingly dry she thought, these beds were freaking fantastic, if you're fully naked and not in wet pyjamas it manages to completely dry up. After all, she remembered they had completely soaked the bed while making love.

Thinking of getting soaked, she got fluttering feelings in her stomach when she thought back of the moment Chloe was wetting her panties on top of her. “Oh god we really went all the way.”

More embarrassment now crept into her mind, remembering how they had attracted way too much attention by low key making love in the hot tub with loads of people having seen that.

"I'm never gonna drink any more alcohol for the rest of my life." Luna thought while suffering from a hangover.

"Water" She was thirsty as hell but luckily there was plenty of ice cold water in their mini fridge across the room but that meant getting out of bed, and right now she felt very naked... She wasn't really the bravest when it came to being nude around others.

Luna her internal voice was now starting to argue with her, "Stop being a chicken... it's okay if Chloe sees you naked, she literally stuck her tongue inside your vagina last night, it's safe to say she already has seen your private parts from up close."

Luna let out a groan, last night was truly amazing, but she was struggling a bit coming to terms that she has had full blown sex with another girl, and there was no sugar coating it.

Although in hindsight, all of that didn't matter because deep down she got a warm and fuzzy feeling in her stomach just from thinking about Chloe and what had happened last night, it was pushing away her embarrassment and was making her feel butterflies in her stomach. She had no regrets.

"So this is what love feels like."

_________________________________

Luna carefully crawled out of bed to not wake up Chloe and tip toed towards the mini fridge, halfway there she realized her bladder was feeling more uncomfortably full than she thought. Maybe she should've just wet the bed once more, now that she thinks about it, they probably did wet the bed in their sleep anyway. On the other hand, their room toilet was closed as well as it was probably past morning already, shower was still an option...

Actually she already had a better idea... and naughtier as well.

Luna was uncomfortable while standing butt naked in the middle of the room, but that didn't stop her from pausing and gazing around their room, it looked like a mini tornado had gone through. How did her panties manage to get all the way on top of the cupboard? Chloe must have thrown them there by accident when she took them off of her.

Hold up, Chloe's panties were hanging off of the corner of the TV, how the hell did they get up there??

Luna blushed a little when she realised she must've thrown them up there when pulling them off from her.

The rest of their clothes were scattered everywhere, she recognized her bra laying under one of the chairs while Chloe's blouse somehow had managed to land on the other chair across the room. Chloe’s shorts ended up laying in the middle of the room and to Luna’s surprise her phone was laying a little bit further, she quickly picked it up and was just happy it wasn't broken or lost.

Luna got to the fridge, crouched and opened it to get the bottles of water out, she checked behind her to check on Chloe, who was still sleeping like a rock.

While still being crouched she relaxed her bladder.

*pssssshhh*

Relief washed over her as she was letting her morning pee pour out of her and stream onto the carpet, making a hissing sound throughout the room. A puddle was quickly forming and growing at her feet as she was emptying her entire bladder on the carpet in front of the mini fridge.

*psssh*

Almost a minute later her stream subsided, she felt naughty and slightly turned on letting her pee run freely like that.

Leaving a puddle she tip toed back to the bed with her phone and the bottles of water in her hands, trying to not make any further sounds. When she got back in bed, carefully to not wake Chloe, she quickly downed a whole 0.5L bottle of water, she really needed that... she started sipping from a second bottle already when she could feel sleepiness wash over her. She quickly dozed off again.

A while later Luna opened her eyes again and stretched her arms, slowly waking up, realizing she had dozed off. She quickly pulled up the sheets as she realized her chest was exposed and was greeted by Chloe who was laying next to her. Realizing she was also slowly waking up.

They looked at each other and started laughing, they were a complete mess.

They still had their messed up make up on from last night, paired with their hair being a complete mess, it looked hilarious.

Chloe let her gaze go around their room, seeing all the chaos she got a smile on her face.

"Damn so that really happened, this is the second time on this cruise that i wake up and think it was all probably a dream... awch... my head though"

Luna confirmed her own hangover while Chloe's gaze landed on the big wet spot on the carpet in front of their mini fridge. "Hold up, that wasn't there last night?"

Luna blushed a little bit about her naughty morning pee. "I woke up earlier and went for some water and i really needed to pee, i guess i was feeling a bit naughty."

"Damn that's hot!" Chloe's eyes widened as she said it. "Wish i could've seen that!"

Luna blushed shyly.

"I'm bursting to pee as well though." Chloe announced while yawning.

Luna sleepily said, "Just go in bed, i don't mind, you don't need to ask."

"I could do that... or i could also do it on the carpet? Should i?"

Now Luna's attention peeked, she didn't want to miss that show, Chloe fully nude and peeing the carpet is something that would come straight out of a wet dream.

"uhm... yes please! I definitely want to see that!"

"Damn, knowing you'll be watching is making me nervous though." Chloe shyly admitted.

Luna carefully pushed a little, "awww, i wanted to see that!"

After some more convincing Chloe finally got up out of bed. Luna her eyes were glued to Chloe and her body, fully naked she walked to the middle of the room and spread her legs.

"Oh god please stop staring, it's embarrassing!"

"I'm sorry it's hard not to!"

Luna was holding her breath as she watched, a few seconds later the first trickle dribbled on the carpet, soon followed by splattering when Chloe’s stream of pee hit the carpet.

Some of her pee went down her legs while most of it was spraying around on the carpet, soaking the carpet and her shorts that were still laying there.

Instantly Luna got turned on by this amazing sight and she couldn't resist, she started playing with her pussy under the blanket while watching her girlfriend stand fully naked, spraying her pee all over the carpet.

"Omg that's so freaking hot!" Luna squealed,

"Haha... hold on, are you playing with yourself right now?"

"uhm... no?" Luna lied while she could already feel her face get completely red.

Chloe was done peeing and crawled back in bed and got next to Luna while she looked at her.

"Luna... you're a terrible liar!" Chloe said while laughing out loud. "It's totally fine, you don't need to be embarrassed about it!"

"In fact, it's kinda hot!" Chloe admitted,

Luna felt a bit shy about it although she knew Chloe was being honest.

Chloe invited Luna in an embrace and while being shy about the fact they both weren’t wearing a single piece of clothing, she gladly accepted.

She was surprised at herself how comfortable she was with laying right next to her, in fact she really enjoyed the feeling of their naked bodies against each other.

They lazily stayed in bed while cuddling and talking about stuff, after last night it was easier for both girls to talk about more intimate stuff about each other, Luna loved how much she was learning about Chloe.

Although Luna already had a pretty good guess about this, Chloe admitted last night was her first time ever.

Luna talked about how it was her first time getting her pussy eaten and how much she had loved it.

Then Chloe revealed something that was a total surprise to Luna.

"Until yesterday i was kinda scared, because on the same day we first kissed at the party, you said afterwards you were still very conflicted about having a girlfriend. I could tell you were struggling with your feelings and I just kept wondering. What if she changes her mind or was wrong about her feelings and after the cruise ends, just gets back with some guy."

Chloe let out a long sigh, "I have gotten so used to feeling miserable that when I’m actually happy i get this uneasy feeling that it's only temporary, and you have no idea how happy you've made me lately! I think I’m just scared of losing you."

Luna could feel herself become emotional over Chloe opening up about herself.

"But then what you said yesterday in the pool, made me realize I’m worrying for nothing." Chloe started blushing while finishing her little story.

"Well i was pretty drunk to be honest." Luna joked, while quickly adding, "Don't worry, i still love you."

Chloe responded with her trademark smile, "Love you too."

Now it was Luna's time to admit that she was really shy being naked, and scared of having to get out of bed right now.

"That's so cute!" Chloe responded.

"And if I’m completely honest, i loved what happened last night but I’m also pretty embarrassed about it, i never thought i would go that far." Luna admitted.

Luna explained and admitted how she was struggling a little with coming to terms with having had sex last night, it suddenly all went a little bit fast. But Chloe immediately comforted her.

"I don't mind at all if you want to take it a bit slower from now on, just tell me."

Chloe did a fantastic job comforting Luna, she was already feeling a lot better about it all.

"And don't worry about earlier," Chloe almost whispered in her ear, "You don't need to be embarrassed about it, in fact i love it that you were playing with your pussy earlier."

Luna couldn’t help getting flustered in the moment.

After a while longer they decided it was time to get up and take a shower, after their late night activities it was definitely needed. When Luna asked who was gonna shower first she got greeted with a mischievous smile on Chloe's face when she asked,

"If you want to, we could shower together."

Luna's eyes widened, the idea was definitely scary at first, but after their intimate talk and Chloe's comforting about her shyness she felt like taking a leap and accepted.

They both got out of bed while naked and went on their way to the shower, but halfway through Luna suddenly stopped, "I kind of have to pee again actually."

Chloe got a mischievous grin on her face that Luna had seen a few times before already.

"Just go on the carpet, no need to be shy about it!"

In fact Luna was shy about it, but she was also getting aroused by the simple idea of peeing on the carpet in the middle of the room while Chloe is watching her. Seconds later she had made up her mind.

"God that's so hot!" Chloe squealed,

Luna was happily emptying her bladder in the middle of the room, adding her own pee to the puddle Chloe had made earlier.

Man she loved this cruise and everything on it.

After leaving a big puddle in the middle of the room they both got in the shower, helping each other wash of the remains of their last night love making while Luna was getting more comfortable with being naked with Chloe with each passing second.

After just a few minutes they were already cuddling under the shower, Luna felt herself getting more and more comfortable, exploring each others body while enjoying the warm shower. Cuddling turned into making out and Luna liked how she could feel Chloe starting to reach for her butt, both were feeling turned on again by this point but decided that this was enough fun in the shower for now, although Luna caught herself wishing it had turned into more sex.

They dried themselves off and started looking on what to wear, which was quite different from last few days, normally they would give each other privacy by one of them going into the bathroom to get dressed.

Now both were only wearing panties while poking in each others suitcases to pick out what the other was gonna wear today.

Luna got hold of one of Chloe's jeans, she recognized it as she remembered her wearing it sometimes, it was tight fitting and showed off her ass fantastically.

"I love it when you wear these jeans, your ass looks amazing in them! It would be cool to see you wet them!" Luna was being bold at this point, but she felt completely comfortable with Chloe.

"Aren't we roughly the same size?" Chloe said, "Why don't you wear them!"

"Am i allowed to wet in them?"

"Of course!"

In the end they got dressed and Luna was wearing Chloe's jeans and top while Chloe was wearing one of Luna's jeans and one of her shirts.

They were just messing around but having a great time while Luna felt like the worst of her hangover was already gone.

They got to cleaning up their room once they got clothed but not before Chloe started laughing and asked how Luna had managed to get her panties on top of the TV.

Just as everything was tidy again someone knocked on their door, not knowing who it was they opened and got surprised by Peyton, Liv and Jake. Apparently they were going around the ship and were about to go have early lunch (they had missed breakfast) And wondered if they were still in their room as they passed it anyway on their way to the restaurant.

To be fair the timing was perfect as they were getting hungry so they were about to go on their way when suddenly they heard their names as they stepped out of their door.

"Are you two Luna and Chloe?"

"Yes" Luna recognized the man from a few days ago, he was their... neighbour... She instantly realized what this was about...

"Next time if you decide to have sex in the middle of the night, could you be a little bit more quiet. My two children couldn't sleep until hours into the night and i had to answer some very difficult questions this morning!"

Luna could feel herself sink through the floor from embarrassment. And still sinking... sinking down through the floors of the ship....

The man then started doing an impression of them with a high pitched voice while moaning "Ooooh Chloe!!! Oooooh Luna, stop I’m about to come!!!!"

Peyton, Liv and Jake where standing with open mouths and shocked expression at what the man was saying.

"And you both being girls doesn't make it any easier to explain!!" He ended his rant with this and slammed his door shut leaving Luna and the others in shock.

Luna was still sinking... her embarrassment was endless, she was now sinking down the ocean... all the way down until she reached the bottom of the ocean, sitting with the fishes... she wished she could stay on the bottom of the ocean there, so she didn't need to face this embarrassment.

Peyton, Liv and Jake had tears rolling off their cheeks, laughing their asses off so hard they couldn't breath and were wheezing. Chloe had a slight grin on her face, she could see the funny side of this, but Luna felt bad and extremely embarrassed. She wanted to get a move on and go to the restaurant so she could try to forget this ever happened, but Peyton, Liv and Jake were laughing so hard they could barely stand up let alone walk.

When suddenly Peyton blurted out,

"I'm pissing myself!"

None of them had expected this, at least not from Peyton, she was wearing a really cute and lose white skirt and they could all see how she was standing with her legs crossed while pee was flowing from under her skirt and down her legs.

Surprisingly she was still laughing with tears coming out of her eyes while she was still clearly going in her panties. Jake laughed even more while Liv suddenly went from laughing mode into shocked mode in less than a second.

Luna and Chloe were intrigued, especially when Peyton didn't seem to care nearly as much as she usually would.

"Omg i can't believe i just pissed myself!" Peyton almost shouted,

They all finally got their shit together and had stopped laughing while Peyton was shaking of the last drops off of her legs, luckily she didn’t have socks on and was wearing flip flops so it didn't matter as much that they had gotten wet.

"Peyton are you okay?" Liv asked worried as if a horrible event had just taken place.

Jake comforted her, "Don't worry about it, it's not a big deal, in fact it made everything even funnier!"

At least this had changed the focus away to a different event, Luna felt lucky.

"Luckily it's just your panties, it's not like other people will see." Chloe added.

Peyton was still standing in the small puddle she had made, when she sheepishly said,

"Well... I’ve seen you guys wet your pants so many times by now." Peyton reasoned , "I guess wet panties isn't that special, right?"

"If you say so, i guess?" Liv answered reluctantly,

The others all agreed with what Peyton just said, even Jake.

“Hey don’t worry about it.” Luna comforted,

"I do want to go and change these wet panties though..."

"Lets pass by Vicky and Selena first then." Luna added.

They decided to walk along as the room of Vicky and Selena wasn't that far away from theirs, and as they hadn't heard from them yet they could just as well go knock. On the way there the others were still teasing Luna and Chloe about what they had just heard.

"So how was the rest of the party after I left?" Peyton finally asked,

"Very eventful." Luna answered truthfully but didn't go further into it, she felt like after what happened recently she had had enough embarrassing things been known about them.

Soon they all stood in front of Vicky and Selena’s door and knocked but nobody opened. Just as they thought they weren't in their room they heard some movement going on behind the door.

Suddenly the door opened a crack and they could see Selena's head poke out, her hair looked terrible and she still had her messed up make up from last night on. She looked horrible...

Selena answered in a sleepy voice "Oh it's you guys, uhm, right now is not really..."

They'll never know what she was about to say because at that moment Peyton suddenly barged in, "Guys hurry up and get dressed! I'm getting hungry!"

They all followed without giving it a second thought and before they knew it they were standing in the middle of the room.

They were taking in the contents of the room and slowly letting the scene sink in.

Clothes were spread out everywhere across the room, and were that panties on the floor laying in front of them?

Vicky was still in bed, covering herself with the blanket with a horrified look on her face, she also didn't look any better than Selena. On second glance, shockingly they could tell she was naked under the blanket, and so was Selena who was covering herself with only a blanket. And then it dawned on the group...

"Hold up..." Peyton said while her eyes were widening in shock.

"Holy shit you guys..." Luna said,

Chloe had a hard time holding in her laughter, "Guess we're not the only ones who had a great time last night!"

"Wait... the two of you?? I could expect it from Luna and Chloe... But you guys?!!" Peyton was shouting from shock.

"Why? How?!" Liv added,

"I don't know." Vicky said with a rasp voice, "I can't remember shit."

"Please don't be so loud, my head hurts." Selena said in a low voice.

"Damn you girls are wild." Jake said with a stupid grin on his face.

When things finally cooled down (Vicky and Selena hadn’t answered a single question yet.) Peyton, Liv and Jake decided to go on to the restaurant while Luna and Chloe decided to wait up for Selena and Vicky, mostly because Luna wanted to avoid getting teased more by the other group.

By the time they got ready it seemed their hangover had gotten a bit better already, they met each other outside their room.

"So..." Luna started,

"Please don't." Vicky said, clearly still embarrassed,

"We don't want to talk about it." Selena quickly added.

Chloe couldn't resist, "But at least you enjoyed yourselves right?"

"Shut up." Both Selena and Vicky answered at the same time.

Luna and Chloe glanced at each other and grinned, but they decided to drop it as both girls seemed to be seriously embarrassed at what had happened.

They weren't feeling it yet to go eat and instead they found this really cool bar out on the deck that was selling all sorts of freshly made juices and smoothies, they went with some infused water with all sorts of fruits to shake off their hangovers.

The infused water with fruits was doing wonders for their hangovers and they started to enjoy their time at the bar out in the sun, they got another drink and ended up staying for a while longer.

____________________________

When they had enough of the infused drinks they finally left the bar and got on their way to the restaurant to get lunch, as they left Luna announced she needed the bathroom, as her bladder was starting to fill at a pretty fast rate by now. The others all acknowledged their own needs.

“Hey guys, remember the toast we all did yesterday night?” Vicky suddenly said,

“Yes.” They all acknowledged while Luna already knew where this was headed, at least she was kind of hoping it would.

Vicky asked energetic, “If the toilet at the restaurant is red or the line is too long we skip it entirely! What do you guys say?”

The restaurant in question they were going to was the main and biggest one on the ship, and at this hour it will be full of people. Knowing that, it’s almost impossible the line at that toilet wouldn’t be long at this point as a ton of people would gather there at this hour.

Luna started to feel a bit nervous but she agreed, and so did the others so they went on their way.

Arriving at the restaurant none of them got surprised when they saw the massive line at the toilets, they walked past it without missing a beat and towards the entrance of the restaurant.

Selena asked worried, “Guys are we really doing this? I really need to pee right now and look at how many people are in there.”

Luna completely understood Selena’s worries, it was in the middle of the day and she could see it was packed with families, couples, elderly people and children alike. All types of people were enjoying their lunch and on top of that, it was an open space with mostly regular tables with chairs and sometimes a couch so they would have minimal cover even if they would wet themselves on their seats. If they would wet their pants a lot of people would notice for sure.

“Remember what we said last night?” Vicky asked while grinning, “About chickening out?”

“Oh so you do remember some things from last night!” Chloe joked.

Oh Luna definitely remembered, and sure Luna was nervous about what they were about to do.

But she was so much more excited in comparison!

“Lets just do it, it’s really not a big deal if people see us wet ourselves!” Vicky added.

Chloe added her own words of encouragement, “Agree, we wet ourselves so many times yesterday, we shouldn’t worry and just let ‘go’ in our pants!”

A grin came on Selena’s face, “I was just checking if you guys weren’t chickening out!”

Selena casually added, “Alright, lets just wet our pants once we’re sitting down at the table.”

They all agreed in unison.

“Good idea, because I really need to pee.” Luna added,

All sorts of emotions were rushing through Luna as they entered the buffet style restaurant, one by one they picked their utensils and plate and waited in line. Vicky was first in line, followed by Selena, then Chloe and Luna being the last of the group.

It was clear Vicky was feeling herself the most confident right now, actually with previous wettings it was often Vicky that would wet herself first, she was more confident about it than the others, which made sense knowing she had grown up in a household where it wasn’t frowned upon to wet your pants.

But Luna wasn’t gonna lose to Vicky this time! She wasn’t gonna wait until they would sit down at a table to wet herself, she was feeling cheeky and wanted to let out a few spurts in her pants right now, having that nice wet feeling in her crotch.

Somehow, in the moment Luna felt it was less embarrassing for her to wet herself than what had happened earlier with the neighbour, in fact she didn’t mind that much being seen with a wet spot on her pants right now.

Luna tried to relax her bladder but nothing came out... stage fright? After all, there were a lot of people around, including an old couple right behind her that were also standing in line. But that wasn’t gonna stop her!

Luna licked her lips and gave a push, letting out a spurt of pee in her panties, dampening them.

It felt good but surely letting out more would feel better, this probably wasn’t even enough to show a wet spot on her jeans, correction, Chloe’s jeans.

Her excitement was building, with shaky hands she picked up a piece of bread and put it on her plate.

She moved up in line and was now standing in front of the salad bar.

Her heart was pounding in her chest when she started pushing again, this time she felt like letting out more than before, knowing it would cause a visible wet spot only made her more aroused.

She enjoyed the feeling of warm pee, soaking through her panties and into her jeans.

For a brief moment she had felt the familiar warm glow in her panties that she loved so much, she was already looking forward to emptying the rest of her bladder knowing how good it would feel.

While putting a salad together on her plate she checked her crotch, she could see a wet spot that was still soaking and slowly expanding in her jeans from her long spurt, it was about the size of a baseball.

The line slowed down now, they had to wait for people in front of them while picking out their food.

Meanwhile while waiting Luna started feeling warm and fuzzy on the inside, she wanted to let out more. In fact she could feel her bladder start to relax on it’s own.

Luna started to zone out, with a calm feeling coming over her when in a matter of seconds, her hands stopped shaking. Realizing she wasn’t bothered if people would see her wet pants, even if she released more.

She relaxed and let out another big spurt in her pants, enjoying her pee streaming in her already soaked panties. She glanced down to see her pee stain was growing bigger again, yet she felt perfectly calm about it while enjoying herself. She was wetting her pants right here next to the buffet with loads of people around her and it was making her feel euphoric at this point!

She could feel her bladder start to relax on it’s own again, although this time she didn’t feel like fighting it, so what if people would see her wet her pants? At this point it wasn’t a big deal any more! A shiver went down her spine knowing what she was about to do.

Without any hesitation she relaxed and let her pee stream in her panties, making her pussy get engulfed in warm wetness, glancing down she could already see the wetness spreading all over her crotch. And yet, she didn’t feel like stopping, in fact, she felt comfortable about letting it flow while enjoying it!

A blissful feeling washed over her as she could now feel her pee was spreading to her butt while also going down to her knees.

“Ah what the heck, it feels amazing so why would she stop now?” In a whim she completely relaxed her bladder...

*psssssssh*

Luna loved how she could hear herself pissing her pants while feeling her pee stream cascading down her legs, and she wasn’t even thinking of stopping her flow, she was gonna empty her bladder right here and now.

Her pee had reached her shoes now while also soaking her socks when she noticed the others were looking at her with a surprised expression, a second later they all got a grin on their face when they could see Luna was enjoying herself.

Luna couldn’t help it and a grin came over her face, she was relishing this moment. With her mouth slightly open, shoulders dropped, completely in the moment of wetting herself, soaking her pants and creating a big puddle where she stood.

When she was done and had pushed out the last spurt into her panties she let out a loud sigh.

“Holy shit that felt amazing!”

People were now staring and whispering... how could they not, she was standing in her own puddle in soaking wet faded jeans that showed the wet stain very clearly, anyone could tell she had just wet herself.

Although knowing that, it didn’t take away how great it had felt for Luna... funny enough, she still felt no regret about emptying her bladder on a whim.

Suddenly she heard from behind her, “Did that girl just have an accident?”

“I don’t think that was an accident sweetheart.”

Luna turned around and quickly apologized but surprisingly the old couple waved it away saying it wasn’t that big of a deal.

Even though people were looking at her, for some reason she didn’t really feel embarrassed about this, or rather, she felt a weird kind of proud of what she had done.

“Damn Luna, that must’ve felt great!” Chloe blurted out,

Luna sheepishly nodded while blushing.

“And i thought i was being bold!” Vicky said,

Vicky turned around and showed off her own wet spot on her crotch about the size of a baseball, which now looked silly compared to the soaked jeans of Luna.

Now the employee behind the counter chimed in, “Girl, you have some serious guts to wet yourself on purpose like that!”

Once again Luna apologized for what she had done.

“No no, it’s fine, you don’t need to apologize for it!” The man said, “Now what would you like to eat?”

Luna was savouring the moment, her wet panties were clinging to her skin while the cool touch of her wet jeans reminded her of how anyone could see that she had wet herself on purpose.

They all took their sweet time and continued through the buffet, picking out what ever they wanted. Surprisingly Luna felt comfortable in her wet jeans while she realised she wasn’t the only one.

She noticed Selena and Chloe were enjoying some spurts in their pants as well, by now they had a decent sized wet spot on their own pants, on top of that it was funny to see Chloe wearing her jeans and having a wet patch on them.

She could tell the others were also enjoying themselves and weren’t bothered with people seeing it.

Luna noticed how Vicky was squirm ish when standing next to her at the buffet, “Need to pee that bad?” Luna asked,

“Yea kinda,” Vicky answered, “actually.”

When suddenly Vicky briefly turned to Luna, spread her knees a little, and promptly pushed a long spurt into her pants. Luna could hear a brief hissing sound with drops of pee falling straight to the ground.

The wet patch of Vicky glistened and got much bigger, it was already spreading all over her crotch by now.

The look on Vicky’s face showed how much she was enjoying this, Luna could see she was really aroused by now so she decided to poke a little.

“Trust me, It feels even better if you let it all out.” Luna said

“Ah screw it, I know you’re right!” Vicky suddenly blurted out,

Vicky moved on to the next section of the buffet, making it that she was standing with her back to Luna.

A few seconds later Luna could hear the hissing start, the small wet spot on Vicky’s butt started to grow while pee started cascading down her jeans, making it shiny from wetness. It was clear she just felt like relieving her full bladder and didn’t seem to care any more if people were looking. While Vicky was midstream Selena popped up next to them.

“Omg you guys seriously can’t even wait until we get to our table?” Selena laughed,

Vicky finished in her pants and let out a “aaaaah”, without any shame. When they all had the food they wanted they went on and found themselves a free table.

The moment they were all seated Chloe suddenly blurted out,

“Oh god I need to pee so bad!” without hesitating she let out a long sigh, “aaaaah yes.”

Chloe sat reclined on her chair, legs spread and was relieving herself in her pants, pee was pouring from her chair and making a puddle on the ground while her pants were getting more and more soaked with each second. She wasn’t even fully done yet or Selena had started to relieve herself as well where she was sitting.

Luna could see how her girlfriend was completely soaking her loaned jeans and couldn’t stop smiling, they were having a great time right now and were completely ignoring the people who were staring at them.

Some people were chuckling, some were debating about it being between crazy and normal on this cruise, others were discussing how that might actually be a better idea than standing in that long ass line. But in the end, some people seemed to agree with what they had just done and they didn’t get in trouble with it at all.

When Selena and Chloe were done peeing they all started eating their lunch when suddenly,

“Hey where did you get that? I didn’t see that lying around.” Selena pointed at a waffle that was laying on Luna’s plate,

Luna pointed to where she found it and Selena cursed.

“Shit, i want one too but I literally just pissed myself.”

They figured Selena was just a tad too shy to walk through the restaurant back to the buffet in soaked pants, which was understandable.

Vicky comforted, “Don’t worry about people seeing your wet pants, it really doesn’t matter.”

“Just go and get the waffle.” Chloe said, “I’ve had one yesterday, they’re really good.”

After a few seconds of weighing her options Selena suddenly stood up,

“Screw it, it doesn’t matter, i want one of those waffles!”

They kept eating their food while they watched Selena walk back to the buffet, the entire back of her jeans was completely soaked. Her butt wiggled a little bit while walking and Luna and Chloe had noticed how Vicky’s eyes followed Selena.

While Chloe still had food in her mouth, “So tell us Vicky, how was she in bed?”

Vicky almost choked on her food while Luna was laughing hard, once she recovered she reluctantly explained.

“We we’re drunk as hell and neither of us can really remember.” Vicky explained shyly, “It was a one time thing, whatever that may have been.”

“Alright then, keep your secrets.” Luna joked,

She had a pretty good idea that they did remember at least enough to know what happened but were using it as an excuse. But oh well, it’s understandable if they want to keep it to themselves.

Selena came back with her waffles and while eating they talked about everything that had happened yesterday night while also thinking of plans on what to do today.

“I can’t believe what you two did in the hot tub last night!” Vicky said with raised voice,

“Hehe, yea that happened.” Luna chuckled while blushing, “So that you still remember?”

“I remember everything until the moment I entered our room.” Vicky explained,

How convenient.

“But you two were already having fun in the hot tub as well,” Chloe now pointed out, “I mean it when i say this, you don’t need to be embarrassed about it!”

Selena and Vicky were definitely embarrassed about it, Luna and Chloe both also promised they won’t tell any one at their school what had happened, (although they can’t promise that for Peyton and Liv of course.) Which Selena and Vicky thanked them for.

Now that they had started talking Luna and Chloe kept cautiously asking about last night, Vicky claimed it was a one time thing that’ll never happen again and concluded with saying she was straight.

Selena didn’t answer immediately, and after assuring her once more they’ll keep all of it a secret Selena admitted.

“After last night I’m pretty sure I’m bi... I hope that’s ok.” Selena admitted shyly,

Luna got surprised while Chloe said she had heard her say it last night in the hot tub. They both reassured her it was all fine.

Selena now directed herself to Vicky, “I still see you as my best friend so please don’t get any weird ideas! Although I can’t deny i really enjoyed last night, so I’m a bit confused about everything right now.”

“Wait so you do remember last night?” Chloe asked surprised,

Selena said while starting to blush heavily, “Yea some of it, but not gonna say anything.”

They continued to try getting more out of her but she wouldn’t budge, so the conversation carried over towards what they were gonna do after this.

“So what do you guys want to do after this?”

___________________________

All four of them were hanging out in the swimming pools, enjoying the slides and various other activities.

Occasionally going to the bar for drinks or ice cream. They had all agreed on the swimming pool, as they hadn’t nearly spend enough time there yet. They had all walked to their room in pissed pants to get changed into their bikini’s and fresh clothes.

Funnily enough, after a while of swimming they ended up in exactly the same hot tub as yesterday.

“Don’t be embarrassed if you two want to make out!” Chloe shouted loud enough so surrounding people probably heard it.

“Shut up!” Selena and Vicky said simultaneously, followed up by Vicky saying. “Hey you two, try not to have sex in public this time!”

They kept making fun of each other for a while for what had happened last night, when suddenly Chloe spoke up.

“I love how you just pissed yourself earlier like it wasn’t a big deal.”

Vicky chimed in, “And you were clearly enjoying it!”

Luna started to blush a little before answering, “I did, and I have no regrets!”

The others all agreed with having no regrets,

“It’s so much nicer not having to worry about toilets with this drug, and I’ll admit, it feels really nice to just let go in my pants.” Selena admitted nonchalantly.

The others all agreed again, not ashamed of admitting they liked it.

Luna added, “I’m already looking forward to doing it again when we get out of the pool.”

The others eagerly agreed.

“Proposition,” Chloe started, “We empty our bladders right now here in the hot tub, order fresh drinks and not pee any more until we leave and go changed.”

“So get changed in our clothes with a full bladder and just piss ourselves straight away?” Luna questioned.

“Exactly!”

Luna could already feel the excitement building... It wasn’t even about the convenience any more, they just simply enjoyed wetting their pants!

The four girls emptied whatever was in their bladders in the hot tub and ordered fresh drinks from one of the employees walking around.

They were already looking forward to the next time they would have to pee, knowing it was gonna be in their fresh clothes.

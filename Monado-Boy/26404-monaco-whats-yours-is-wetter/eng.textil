Welcome to my first ever fanfiction attempt, both for omorashi.org and ever, let's hope it goes well.

I don't own anything, Monaco: What's yours is mine belongs to Pocketwatch games.

###

The heist wasn't going well.

The Gentleman had sent four of them to the casino, but already the Mole and the Pickpocket had returned to their hotel (the Mole's "freedom spoon" had practically snapped while trying to dig through some particularly tough wall and the Pickpocket's pet monkey, who was trained to collect loose change from anywhere from pockets to cases, had been knocked out by a guard after he'd found his wallet in the monkey's hand.)

That left the Red head and the Lookout.

They'd cleaned out most of the casino but had to hide from a horde of seven to ten guards after the Red head had accidentally set off an alarm, a mistake that would haunt the both of them. The vents were surprisingly large, just high enough to crouch in, giving them both enough room to wait for the guards to stop searching for them.

Unfortunately for both of them, while they had been in the hotel's bathroom before the heist, they hadn't actually taken the time to use it, that combined with the champagne they'd had to celebrate their last successful heist and their bladders were both aching.

"Nice work on the alarm back there." the Lookout said after five minutes of hiding, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

"I'm sorry darling, but how was I to know the door had an alarm?"

"Should of brought the Hacker instead of Mole, then we wouldn't be in this mess."

Minutes passed, and with each that passed their desperation grew. Until, that is, one of them spoke up.

"Knew I should of taken a leak back at the hotel."

The Red head squirmed slightly, trying to keep her own situation as discreet as possible.

"I have to agree, although I have to admit I'm revealed to know I'm not the only one in this embarrassing situation."

"Obviously, you had more champagne then any of us." sneered the Lookout.

The Redhead chose not to reply.

As the pair of female thieves sat there in complete darkness they both came to the same conclusion.

"We have to get out of here. If we stay here much longer we're either going to get caught or piss ourselves."

Despite how "crude" the Redhead found the Lookout's remark, she couldn't deny she was right, it was evident that both of them were now in pain from their bladders as they both occasionally squirmed in desperation.

After a quick check of the corridor outside the vent they both started towards the nearest exit or bathroom, whatever they ran into first. They eventually found an exit without running into any more guards and they quickly half limped towards their hotel across the street.

Just as they made it to the alleyway next to the hotel the Redhead stopped, doubling over and quickly rushing to the wall of the hotel, swiftly pulling her dress up and her thong down before unleashing her bladders contents with a loud, unladylike and revealed sigh. The Lookout tried her best to ignore both the groans of pained pleasure from the Redhead and the gushing of her urine while staring the other way.

After a solid thirty to forty seconds of bliss the Redhead turned to the Lookout.

"Aren't you going to relieve yourself? you're clearly in pain."

"I'm fine, like I said, you had more to drink then me, I can make it back to the my room."

With that the Lookout started making her way back to her room, her bladder throbbing in pain as the Redhead followed behind, smirking.

They finally got back to the fourth floor of the hotel and the Lookout made a mad dash for her room, unfortunately the Mole had been mending his "freedom spoon" a bit too close to the door. As the Lookout entered she found herself hitting the ground after colliding with the Mole's makeshift workbench. Her bladder gave up halfway through her fall. She landed face first, urine pooling around her as the Redhead stood smirking in the doorway, the Mole started complaining about the Lookout damaging his "freedom spoon" more and the other five members of their band of thieves just looked at the Lookout as the puddle finally stopped growing.

Later the Redhead had gone to bed, her dignity intact. The Lookout had went to bed trying to find a silver lining, but couldn't find anything better then "Atleast I'm not in jail right now."

I was content with leading this at just one chapter and leaving it there......key word being WAS.

With that said, I hope you enjoy chapter two of Monaco: What's yours is wetter (.....I should probably also come up with a better name for this)

Chapter 2: Karmic Justice

The Lookout had been humiliated. She'd been many things, shot, hit, forced into vents on many occasions, but humiliation hurt the most. It had been two weeks since the casino job and they, the Lookout and the rest of their group, had been lying low to avoid arousing suspicion. Had.

The other members of the team had left to perform a job to swap their dental records with someone called Davide or something and now it was just the Redhead (the team didn't think they'd need her to distract any doctors) and the Lookout (They had already scouted out the building on a previous job and knew the layout well). The Lookout wasn't one for revenge, justice was what she craved, what she demanded.

Being as nimble as she was it took the Lookout next to no time sneaking into the Gentleman's room and into his hotel room's bathroom. There she found what she wanted: An alpha blocker. The Lookout didn't have a formal education, but once having to use one of these to distract a guard had left her with some useful knowledge, and she was in luck; the tablets were soluble.

All she had to do now was block the bathrooms, again the Lookout was in luck. There was a door and a vent in each bathroom, blocking them would of been easy. After blocking the bathroom doors with whatever she could get her hands on and stuffing her pillows into the vents the plan was ready to be set into motion.

"I'm happy you finally agreed to talk to me again, it's been terribly boring while you gave me the silent treatment."

Typical thinking only of herself. The Redhead was predictable though effective in heists. She'd already drained two glasses of wine and was already showing minute signs of discomfort.

Half an hour passed and the Redhead was starting to fidget. The Lookout was loving the show. The redhead had already had a third glass and the drunkenness was clearly effecting her.

"You know, I...I expected you to be bitter, but this, this is nice." she slurred while attempting to give the Lookout a strange mix between a pet and a hug.

"Yeah.....you think that."

"W-what you mea-"

She never finished that sentence, she'd passed out.

The rest of the team had returned and the Lookout had decided to enlist some help in the form of the hacker; the group's fast talking part time gamer, part time electronics tamperer.

"what'stheplan?"

"Simple: cut the power, I'll do the rest, all I'll need is five seconds."

It had cost her half of her share for the next heist but it had been worth it. The plan was, again, in motion. The group was gathered in the Gentlemen's room and had been discussing the next steps of the Gentleman's plan. The Redhead had been shaken awake by the Pickpocket when the entered and hadn't had the chance to attempt to open a bathroom door. She was clearly in agony, the only thing that stopped everyone from noticing was the usual buzz from the pre-heist planning.

Suddenly the lights were out and the Lookout took her shot. In one swift movement she'd stood up and delivered a swift shove to the Redhead's abdomen. The results were immediate. Urine gushed from the Redhead and a moan of defeat escaped her.

The Lookout had barely sat back down as the lights flickered back to life. The group immediately turned to the Redhead and were left speechless.

"Again? pour l'amour de Dieu (for god's sake)" groaned the Gentleman, lamenting the fact that another puddle of urine was spreading on his carpet.

The Redhead was still, she didn't react in embarrassment or abstract horror until she'd finished emptying her bladder, after which she stood up and quickly left the room in silence.

"I'vedonemypart. What'syoursismine."

The Lookout smiled as she handed the Hacker his fee, enjoying the fact that she'd gotten revenge on the Redhead.

That was, until she realised that the Redhead hadn't forced her to wet herself, only accidentally made her wait longer. The Lookout shuddered, knowing that Karma was going to get her back in an equally embarrassing way, the only question was, when?

I'm in the mood to write more still and the below part contains more story progression then desperation so there may follow more later today, but I thought I'd post something already. After all, it's been more than long enough.

CHAPTER 20

That night, Hermione had decided to stay in her dormitory. She did not want to risk being seen by any of her classmates who had seen what had happened and had not even be in the mood to play with her privates while they still resembled Ginny’s. She had not even gone to dinner and when she woke up the next morning, she realised she had not even gone to the bathroom anymore.

That mistake now required her immediate attention and Hermione squeezed her hand between her legs as she very carefully got up, glad her bladder had woken her up before the alarm had gone off. She hurried to the bathroom and managed to drop onto the toilet just in time. She peed surprisingly little for how desperate she had felt, but her pee looked really dark and concentrated, which made sense given that she had not even gotten out of bed to go get a drink anymore the night before. She made a mental not to make sure to drink plenty throughout the day.

At breakfast, Hermione was glad to find out not showing herself for a while had helped to avoid too much gossip and apart from a few whispers from people who had witnessed the incident, people seemed to already have forgotten about the story for the most part.

On Friday morning there was a rather boring transfiguration class and near the end of it Hermione was really regretting having had an extra glass of pumpkin juice with breakfast. She did not dare ask professor McGonagall for a bathroom break yet again and could hold it, but her bladder felt painfully full and as soon as class was over, she was on her feet hurrying towards the nearest bathroom was again.

During lunch, as Hermione gulped down another three glasses of juice, Ginny told her about how her experiment was a failure and she had concluded no option could be brewed to give a human wings at least with the knowledge of their time.

“Remember how Snape said a potion like the ones you were working with could help with brewing my potion,” Hermione responded. “I have no clue about that yet, but we will figure that out,” she added, trying to cheer up her friend.

“Okay, I’ll write in my next report how creating wings failed and I’ll focus my research on finding a role for organitinerosum in brewing,” Ginny agreed reluctantly. “Maybe that will indeed turn out to be helpful to you at least.”

“Thanks, Gin,” Hermione replied as she playfully squeezed her friend’s thigh beneath the table.

After lunch, Hermione and Ginny went to the library to once again write their reports. When they were satisfied with their descriptions of their last attempts about two hours later, Hermione was once again starting to feel the effects of the extra drinks she had been having and she crossed her legs when she said:

“So applying pressure during brewing seems to have changed the direction I moved in, but not good enough and thinking about an alternative that might include your research on why Snape said organitinerosum could come in handy there is something I’ll need to do. Using urine from two people seems to be what lead to the new problem we introduced of leaving my clothes behind and I obviously need to solve that first.”

Ginny giggled and replied: “Yeah, and you clearly did need to use a full litre of urine in the potion too.”

“Right,” Hermione agreed, “I really don’t think I could pee that much halfway through class ‘though. I’d have an accident before if I’d drink enough for that before class. I could ask Luna as her bladder seems stronger, but she’s not in that potions class so she probably won’t have time to come pee for me every time I do another attempt.”

Ginny nodded in agreement and Hermione excused herself to go pee again. Just as she turned around to leave, however, Ginny spoke up, making her stop and turn back around to look at her friend.

“Hang on,” Ginny said. “Using your pee and mine together didn’t work out well, but does that mean The urine needs to come from one person.”

Hermione crossed her legs as her bladder contracted angrily now that she was standing up and had yet again decided to delay peeing longer. She replied: “What are you suggesting? That it’s us that are problem and it would work with different people?”

Afraid she was about to say something stupid, Ginny hesitated before replying: “I was thinking... twins.”

Hermione looked confused for a moment before it dawned on her. “That could work,” she exclaimed happily. “'though I’ll ask Snape if we can try it somewhere private.” A little less enthusiastic, she asked: “Who can we ask for that ‘though. I mean Fred is... you know.” Hermione’s mind had obviously gone straight to the twins she knew best, and thinking of Ginny’s late brother there was sorrow in Hermione’s voice.

“Padma and Parvati are in our class, dumbass,” Ginny mentioned, glad to think of something Hermione seemed to have missed for once.

“I’m not sure they’re up to the idea of holding their pee,” Hermione countered, rubbing her thighs against each other thinking of her own need, “but we’ll have to ask them. Maybe we can go look for them after dinner,” she suggested. “Right now I need to pee first ‘though.”

Ginny laughed but got up anyway and followed Hermione to the nearest bathroom, where she decided she could better pee too while she was there anyway. Hermione was glad to notice her pee had a much healthier colour again and decided she could go back to drinking what she was used to with dinner.

(NOT THE END OF CHAPTER 20 YET so no questions for now. If you read this before I post more, feel free to make suggestions or provide me with feedback 'though. I may be able to use some ideas still.)

CONTINUATION OF CHAPTER 20

Dinner went by uneventful and afterwards Hermione hurried towards Parvati before any of the twins would have left.

“Hey Parvati,” Hermione said, “this is going to sound really weird but could you come with us to Padma for a moment? I’ve got something a twin might have the solution for and I was hoping the two of you might want to help.”

Parvati looked a little dumbfounded for a moment. Hermione and Ginny never seemed to have too much of an interest in talking to her and what kind of problem could they have that specifically needed a twins help? After a moment of hesitation, she smiled however, and replied: “Sure, let’s go find Padma. I’m curious what you’ve got.”

The three of them walked over to the Ravenclaw's table and sure enough, Padma was still there talking to some of her housemates, although Hermione noticed she seemed somewhat anxious to get rid of them. As soon as there was a break in the conversation, Parvati asked her sister to join them and Padma gladly stepped aside. After Hermione repeated what she told Parvati, Padma seemed genuinely interested in what they would have to tell.

“Shall we go sit in the library to talk,” Ginny suggested.

Hermione nodded in agreement and Parvati did not seem to mind, but Padma seemed a little reluctant, crossing her legs as she realised this was going to take more than just a few seconds. She felt kind of proud that Hermione of all people asked for her help and followed the others.

Soon the girls sat down in the library. Padma immediately crossed her legs tightly as Hermione began bringing Parvati up to speak about what she was doing in potions class. Despite blushing brightly, she even told about the effects of her last attempt, before she went into the specifics of her problem.

“So what I’ve learned so far is that instead of a litre of water, what actually needs to be in polyjuice potion is urine.”

Padma gasped quietly as Hermione said that and bent forward as subtly as she could manage. At any other moment she would probably have dashed to a bathroom feeling like she was right now, but right as wanted to get up, her sister whispered: “Hey, that’s Hermione talking!” She knew how important Hermione was to Parvati, so she sat back down, grimacing.

“Fresh, human urine,” Hermione went on. “At earlier attempts we saw that using less urine got us only partway there. I... wasn’t comfortable with... producing a full litre of urine halfway through class myself ‘though.”

Padma’s hand disappeared under the table, grabbing her crotch.

“So we tried getting half of that from both of us,” Hermione added nodding towards Ginny.

“Combining urine of two unrelated people is what lead to... that incident,” Ginny jumped in.

“So that’s when we thought twins may work,” Hermione continued. “Would you two be willing to provide me with a litre of your urine – combined that is – a little after the halfway mark of monday's class?”

END OF CHAPTER 20

QUESTIONS FOR CHAPTER 21

- How does Parvati respond.

- How does Padma respond?

*108*2023-01-03 15:29

CHAPTER 21

The twins looked at each other. Padma saw in Parvati’s eyes that she wanted to agree, while she herself was a little disappointed that it was only such a practical issue Hermione had come to seek their help with and nothing that required actual thinking from their side. She still wanted to help ‘though, but she thought a full bladder was really uncomfortable, not to mention that she feared she would not be able to control it while holding so much. Right now ‘though, she didn’t have time to consider things, as her bladder spasmed and reminded her that it currently required to be emptied too. Under the table, she gave her crotch a quick squeez.

“We’ll have to think about that” Padma finally replied. “Can we get back to you tomorrow?”

Hermione agreed, already glad that the twins did not immediately reject the idea.

“See you tomorrow then,” Padma quickly replied before hurrying out of the library, followed by her sister.

Ginny laughed. “I wonder how much Padma was holding right now,” she said. “She was clearly dying to go.”

“Yeah, I hope that was over half a litre and we don’t have to get her to push further Monday. Things might end wet...”

Friday evening was uneventful, as was Saturday until dinner. Ginny had taken the opportunity of her day off to join Harry and Ron at quidditch traing while Hermione had spent most of her time in the library, writing about combining pee from twins could work better and trying to find a better way to apply pressure during the brewing of a potion to suit the lacewing flies in polyjuice potion.

She had not had a breakthrough yet when it was once again time for dinner, which Hermione only noticed when the bell sounded six times.

Hermione quickly packed her bag and got up. Only then, she noticed how badly she had to pee. She cursed herself and wondered if she would ever learn to pay attention to her body’s needs while studying as she quickly made her way to the great hall, taking a bit smaller steps than she usually would to avoid upsetting her bladder.

After dinner, Hermione asked Ginny to join her to go talk to Padma and Parvati again and soon the four of them were on their way to the library once this more, while this time it was Hermione who was nursing a bursting bladder.

“So, have you decided if you can help me out,” Hermione asked when they had all sat down, squeezing her legs together beneath the table.

“We’re willing to try,” Parvati replied, “but we really don’t know if we can or how we should make this work. I mean, we don’t usually plan how much we’ll need to plan.”

As Ginny looked at Hermione, expecting her yo reply, she saw a tense look on her face and when Hermione did not actually reply after a few seconds, she quickly took over.

“We’ve got that covered,” Ginny said, “as you know we’ve been doing this for a few days now and it seems like an easy calculation gives a pretty good estimation of how full your bladder will be.”

“Normally, you produce about a litre and a half of urine per day, mostly while awake, so you produce about 100mL per hour,” Hermione continued as she found she was finally able to speak again. “For that, you drink about two litres, which is about a glass per two hours.”

“Now I wouldn’t advice you to try to avoid the bathroom for five hours,” she continued, realizing it had been even longer since she peed before lunch. “Monday’s potions class is in the afternoon again, so I’ll need your urine around 2pm. If you pee before lunch and then drink two glasses right soon after you sit down for lunch on top of what you normally drink with your lunch, you should be full enough two hours later and will have to hold it for a much shorter time.”

Hermione rubbed her crotch beneath the table as the twins discussed what to say. She was really starting to get desperate to pee and hoped the girls would reply positively soon and she would not have to spend more time trying to persuade them, or worse – although not for her current bladder situation – come up with another plan altogether.

“Drinking two extra glasses with lunch still sounds a lot. I don’t think I would normally go without a bathroom visit for two hours after that,” Padma replied.

“How about we give it a try and see how it works out tomorrow,” Parvati joined in, much more enthousiastically. “Then you could also see if we indeed pee enough with this plan, Hermione.”

Reluctantly, Padma nodded in agreement.

“Awesome,” Hermione exclaimed happily. “Can you come to our common room before lunch tomorrow then,” she quickly asked, already getting up tightly crossing her legs immediately.

The twins nodded and that was all Hermione waited for before finally rushing to the bathroom. As she sat down on the loo, she blushed when she saw how wet her thong had become, despite nobody being there to see it.

QUESTIONS FOR CHAPTER 22

Does the plan work when it is tested the next the day and can the girls pee a full litre in total at 2pm? Or does the plan need to be changed before it's actual execution on monday? If so, what changes are needed?

Oh, don't worry. Luna will be back to play a large role.

And about accidents... they might happen soon 😉

As recently as chapter 17 Hermione didn't really make it. There should be a bigger accident a while further back if I remember correctly, just as there is one for Ginny. I'd suggest you start a chapter 1 'though. The chapters are not stand alone stories.

Wow, is it really a five hour read already? Well, I hope you enjoyed it. I'm trying to get the next chapter out tonight.

I've got some free time again, so here is the next chapter, finally. I'm in the mood to write more, so you may want to hurry giving your input as I might write the next part as soon as tomorrow (no promises 'though!).

CHAPTER 22

Hermione had spent sunday morning trying to find alternative ways to apply pressure on her potion while brewing it. To her frustration, she had found nothing. She was used to pushing on until she found answers, but soon it was almost time for to lunch she realized she would have to get back to the Gryffindor tower.

When Hermione got up from her place in the library, she felt a little excited about what would happen that afternoon, but soon that thought was pushed to the back of her mind by the feeling of an overly filled bladder. It did not surprise Hermione as she had not got up to visit a bathroom since she started studying after breakfast and had not peed since right after she got up that morning, now almost five hours ago.

She quickly crossed her legs until the urge subsided again and walked out of the library. She was glad to notice the bathroom near the exit of the library was empty and quickly took her chance to relieve herself while her need was still manageable, something she did not do enough lately.

Soon, Hermione approached the portrait of the Fat Lady and saw Ginny already waiting for her outside.

“Hey,” she simply said as she looked around for Padma and Parvati just as they came around the corner.

Hermione immediately recognized their stiff walk as that of people in need of a bathroom and when she reached Hermione and Ginny, Padma explained: “We skipped... going before leaving our house to make sure we could still go, so uhm, could we hurry up and go somewhere?” Padma crossed her legs while she spoke, while her sister tried to stand normally, although her face showed that this was challenging for her too.

“Sure, let’s go,” Hermione replied with a slight giggle before leading the girls towards the great hall where lunch would be served and, more importantly to the twins, the bathrooms near it.

In the girls’ room, Padma and Parvati hurried inside two stalls that had, fortunately for them been available and could soon be heard relieving themselves. As they had discussed on their way there, Ginny stood outside the stall Parvati was in and Hermione did the same with Padma, to make sure they actually emptied their bladders. Hermione was shocked by how fast Padma’s stream came to an end and thought she would have to hope Padma could hold more despite how uncomfortable she had already looked, as she had clearly not released anywhere near the half litre Hermione would need from her, unless off course Parvati had a much stronger bladder than her sister.

Soon, the girls sat down for lunch and after they all got their own food and drinks, Hermione handed Parvati and Padma two extra glasses of pumpkin juice each.

“Bottoms up, girls,” she cheered.

Reluctantly, Padma even more so than Parvati, the girls drank the extra liquid like they had promised and they all started enjoying their meals like on any other day.

As she finished their lunch about half an hour later, Hermione was worried to notice Padma’s legs start to jiggle around restlessly beneath the table and about fifteen minutes later when they got up, she saw both girls walk very stiff, betraying how they were struggling with their filling bladders.

The girls had decided they would go to the dungeons to find some privacy, without having to get access to a house’s common room for the four of them. As soon as they were out of earshot of others, Padma complained: “Ah, I really have to go very badly already! I don’t think I can make it until two!”

Parvati bit her lip and crossed her legs tightly as her sister allowed her hand to slide in between her legs. “Come on, Padma, we gotta try this,” she cheered, at least as much to herself as to her sister.

Soon after, however, Padma hurried to grab a flask from Hermione and dashed off into a mostly hidden corner. The others could hear her pull her clothes out of the way, and then a strong stream started. Maybe twenty seconds later, the dungeons were silent again.

As she came back, a red faced Padma handed Hermione the flask back. Hermione could have known by the way she looked at the ground embarrassed, but was still shocked to see only slightly over 300mL of urine in the flask.

“Hey, don’t worry,” Ginny tried to cheer her up, “you tried, and your sister is still hanging on so maybe we can still get there and will just have to change the timing a little."

Parvati could not remember the last time she had had to pee so bad. For minutes now she had not said a word as all her efforts were aimed at keeping her burning bladder under control. This was her chance, however, she thought, to impress Hermione, and so she pushed on. She squirmed, recrossed her legs, bent forward and eventually even grabbed her crotch as the minutes ticked by slowly.

2PM came and went eventually as she pushed even passed their agreed time to try and compensate for her sister’s failure. She had come to realise this was also her chance to finally beat her sister at something for once, and she was filling to fight for it.

Then however, Parvati felt her bladder contract and no matter how hard she squeezed every useful muscle in her body, she felt a drip inch closer and closer to the fabric of her panties, and just before the wave subsided, she lost it.

“Give me a flask,” she cried, turning bright red, “I leaked!”

Parvati rushed of to the same corner her sister had used almost half an hour before and soon a strong stream echoed through the dungeons once again, and for a while longer this time.

Parvati looked sad as she walked back, flask in hand, angry even. “I didn’t make it,” she almost screamed in frustration. “It’s over half a litre but I couldn’t do Padma’s job too!” She looked at her sister furiously, before dragging her out of the dungeons as a tear rolled over her cheek. “Sorry, Hermione,” was all she said as they left.

Hermione did not know what to do. She felt disappointed another problem in her brewing process remained unsolved, but she wa s even more sorry about having started a fight between the sisters. Overwhelmed by her emotions, she let Ginny guide her back to their dorm room, where she dropped on her bed.

Hermione did not get up again until Ginny came to get her for dinner. She ignored both her thirst and her bladder, still unrelieved since before lunch, as Ginny guided her to the great hall, carefully looking out to avoid Padma and Parvati for the time being and sitting down besides Harry and Ron.

“What’s wrong,” Ron asked of all people.

Ginny wanted to shut him op, but that was when Hermione broke and told her friends all about how all her hard work had let to only failures, while they slowly ate their dinner. Hermione did not even notice how she squirmed around beneath the table to control her tired bladder even while she drank more in between parts of her story.

As Hermione concluded her monologue, Harry replied. “This may sound strange, but I may have an option you could try.” He hesitated for a second before continuing more quietly. “Remember when I dated Cho? She would often come see me right after classes to tell me how her day went. Usually, she’d demand I stood outside the door so she could keep talking as she relieved herself, and here’s the thing: each and every day it surprised me how much that girl was peeing. Asking her for help might be a long shot considering you are my friend and how our relationship ended, but her bladder might be just what you need.”

Hermione looked at Ginny nervously, unsure about what to say to that. Should she really try to get Cho’s help? How would Ginny feel about that?

QUESTIONS FOR CHAPTER 23

- Should Hermione ask Cho for help? If so, how will she respond? If not, should she ask Luna, or try herself?

Note that the above decision may decide who gets an important role in the remaining part of this story and will even determine if and when Hermione will finally succeed in her attempts to brew the perfect polyjuice potion. Think about it wisely.

- When should they go ask Cho or Luna (if applicable)? Does Hermione get to pee first? Remember, she just had dinner and she last peed before lunch.

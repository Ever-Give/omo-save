{{:

You're a great writer and I can't wait for the new chapter!!!

}}

Thanks, I won't be able to write this week unfortunately due to family, but the next chapter should be up by next wednesday.

Suddenly not entirely sure when I will be able to continue this, no plans in my head albeit the final two chapters.

{{:

Don't worry take your time!

But I thought you said 5 chapters?

}}

By that I just meant I know what will go on in the final two chapters. The three before that I'm still thinking on.

{{:

Oh hehe I'm stupid! But now I gotcha!

}}

No you're fine:)

Don't hate me!!!!! I know I promised you five more chapters but I began to find this story rather redundant and it's already been dragged on for far too long... I will not continue this story. My sincerest apologies to anyone who liked this.

}}

I'm glad you liked it:)

{{:

Bed wetting done right I love it. All of these are good but that's easily my favorite Chapter. It just seems like the epitome of an accident.

}}

Thank you, I'm very happy you think so:)

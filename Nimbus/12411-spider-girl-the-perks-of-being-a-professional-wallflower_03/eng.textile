No rush but when can we expect the new installment?

I hope to get it up by this weekend. It all depends on when I get internet. (I'm currently on my phone and in the process of moving)

So... I've been playing with where to go next with this story (and totally have an idea) but I think that I need to take a brief hiatus. Trust me, I totally plan to return in a month or so, but I need to take a break. I have a lot planned for this story, but I'm afraid any attempt to write the next couple chapters will come out rushed and lame. I hope you understand:)

I say this with a heavy heart... but I am leaving this website for an indefinite amount of time. I feel awful for leaving in the middle of this story so I will leave the details below on what I had planned to do with this story.

{{:

Ok, so from where we left off I intended for May to continue use of the symbiote. As she spent prolonged times using it, the symbiote would turn her darker and more reckless, to a point where she would risk Gene's life to take down thugs holding him at gunpoint. She would, however, brush this off and continue growing darker. The suit would begin to feed off her bioenergy and in addition to turning her reckless it would drain her, leaving her exhausted until she gave into the "thirst" and killed a man by draining his bioelectricty. She would then proceed to get rid of the suit and join the New Avengers to make up for her sins as the venom spidergirl

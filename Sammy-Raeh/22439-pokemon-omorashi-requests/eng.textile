May I be so daring as to ask the community for what they want to see. I am here to accept pokemon story requests with only a few rules in place. Please read the following lines carefully.

When you request a story give me the basic idea for what you want and some characters, I am more then willing to accept both male and female characters so don't you worry. Try to make sure the characters are at least understandable from an omorashi perspective so that means nothing like Koffing, Muk and Magnamite. I also accept all generations as well. :)

If you want to give me a basic idea or setting then feel free. Whether it's say public desperation, a holding contest or maybe even bondage wetting. If I can fit my head around it I'm willing to give it a try.

Please do not hold high expectations. These will be my first ever publicly posted stories and I'm still very rusty and I'm also very lazy so they may take some time, all I ask is that you do not expect it to be anywhere close to perfect.

That's all I really have to say, feel free to review my stories afterwards and please keep it easy on the reviews. I get overwhelmed very easily.

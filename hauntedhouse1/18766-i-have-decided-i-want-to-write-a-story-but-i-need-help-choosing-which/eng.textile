I plan to write a few stories:

1. A realistic everyday situation

2. A fantasy type (space, medevil)

3. One using character from pop culture, right now it seems like the top ones used are pokemon and harry potter so I would likely go the route of avengers possibly even a television show like the mentalist or castle.

I just cannot choose which type should be my first..so I leave it open to comments..and please include things you have always wanted in stories but have yet to read and I may try to incorporate some of your ideas! If I don't get any responses I will likely just begin with the realistic everyday situation.

Have the team split up and ambush the enemies from two different directions, use a C2 charge on the door to get the room with Jane and John, then throw a stinger grenade to stun them both(For those who don't know, a stinger grenade sends out lots of little hard balls which "sting" and will quickly stun anyone unarmored in the vicinity).

You are correct for the most parts verex except you forgot to add that when it is thrown it takes a few seconds to actually explode since it is setup on the same timer sequence as a flash bang and CS gas grenade.

The team sets 2 C2 breaching charges on each door and stand back as the explosions go off making car alarms go off and they throw in stinger grenades as they move into their assigned rooms and find that most of the hostages had wet themselevs as the explosions and the stingers went off and at this some of the officers on team 2 began wetting their uniforms unable to control themselves.

They get back to base and take a shower after clearing the situation and made a quick change making sure to wash the soiled pants as they got the call for another warrant and were handed the details as they went to the apc

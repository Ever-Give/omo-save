This story is about Scorpi and how he almost wet himself

It was late at night and I was watching a special late night episode of my favorite t.v. show. I was getting tired but I wanted to see the whole episode so I had been drinking pop hoping the sugar would keep me awake and it was working.

When the show was over I had drunk three whole bottles of pop. I turned the tv off and got ready to go to sleep when I felt a small twinge in my bladder but didn't think it was anything to worry about.

(The next morning)

"(Yawns) that was a good episode last night" I said as I woke up and went to the kitchen to make breakfast.

As I was walking towards the kitchen I felt twinge my bladder like the one from last night but stronger.

"That stung a little. Oh well I'll go after breakfast" I said continuing towards the kitchen.

In the kitchen I decided to have a bowl of cereal for breakfast. I got out the bowl and went to get the cereal.

I decided to have coconapple jacks.

I sat the box of cereal down next to the bowl and was about to get the milk when I felt a more powerful jolt in my bladder as the pop from last night caught up to me.

"Oh. I guess it's not a good idea to wait until after breakfast" I said

I was heading towards the bathroom when I remembered something. Last night the toilet stopped working for some reason. I had planned on having it repaired later on today but I was going to have to do it now.

I went to the phone and dialed the correct number.

"Hello" the mixel on the other end said

"Hello. My toilet has stopped working and I need to have it repaired" I replied

"Okay, someone will be over in about an hour or so"

"Thanks" I said before hanging up.

"Okay. I should be able to hold it that long" I assured myself

I decided to wait until after the toilet was repaired and I had relieved myself to have breakfast. I sat there and thought about what I was going to do to today while I waited.

After fifteen minutes of waiting I started to feel the pressure on my bladder building up but I wasn't worried. After 30 minutes of waiting I started squirming in my seat.

"I can hold it in until after the toilet is fixed" I kept telling myself

At 35 minutes I had to cross my legs from time to time. At forty minutes I had started becoming visibly desperate.

"I'll just go and watch some tv to take my mind off of it" I decided

On my way to the living room I felt another wave of desperation and had to stop for a second to stay in control.

"Okay let's see what's on" I said when I got to the living room.

I sat down in a chair, grabbed the remote, and turned the tv on. I flipped through the channels looking for something to watch. Every show that was on was either about water or had something related to water so I turned the tv off because it was only making my need worse.

"Oh. How long is it going to be before that mixel gets here?" I asked myself with a worried tone.

At fifty minutes I had to grab myself whenever I felt a wave of desperation so that I could stay in control. At fifty five minutes I had my legs firmly crossed and my tail firmly pressed against my bladder.

"I hope he g-gets here s-soon" I said as I continued to hold it in.

Five minutes later I heard knocking on the door.

"F-finally, he's here!" I said excited that I wouldn't have to wait much longer to relieve myself.

I got up and headed to the door. On the way there I felt another wave of desperation and I sprung a leak. I was able to stay in control and continued toward the door. Once I reached the door I quickly opened it and was greeted by Torts.

"Hi Scorpi" he said

"H-hi Torts"

He then quickly took notice of my desperation.

"Um, Scorpi. Are you okay?" He asked with a look of concern on his face.

"I-I had to m-much pop to drink l- last n-night and it finally c-caught up to m-me an h-hour ago" I told him

"Oh. Well don't worry I'll have your toilet fixed as soon as possible" he assured me

He quickly found the problem and started fixing it. It took him about ten minutes to repair the toilet. During that time I had reached my limit and my bladder was full.

"There you go. All fixed" he said

"Th-thanks. Um, d-do you think you c-can w-wait in the living r-room? Because-" but before I could finish he interrupted me

"It's okay Scorpi you don't have to explain why. I'll wait in the living room until you're done" he said to me

"Th-thanks" I told him as he headed to the living room

As soon as he was gone I shut the door for extra privacy. Since I'm such a small mixel I have to stand on the toilet when I go. I quickly climbed up onto the toilet. As soon as I had climbed up I got into the right spot.

I then removed my tail from it's position and started peeing. I sighed in relief as my bladder was being emptied and all my liquid escaped into the toilet. I continued peeing for two minutes before I finished. I flushed the toilet and washed my hands before opening the door. I headed out to the living room where Torts was waiting for me.

"I feel so much better" I said as I entered the room.

"I bet you do after holding it in for so long" he said

"Heh heh, yeah. So how much do I owe you?"

"25 mucks"

"Okay" I went and got the 25 mucks and paid him

"Have a nice day Scorpi" he told me as he left

"You too" I then went to the kitchen to eat the cereal I got out earlier.

(Two days later)

I was in the living room watching tv. Torts was coming over and I was waiting for him to get there.

"I wonder when Torts will be here" I said. Just then I heard knocking on the door "That must be him"

I went to the door and answered it. Standing on the other side was Torts

"Hi Torts" I said

"H-hi Scorpi" he replied

Just then I noticed his legs were crossed and his hands were pressed against his bladder

"Are you alright?" I asked him

"Y-yeah. Um c-can I use your b-bathroom?"

"Of course you can. When your done come to the living room because that's where I'll be"

"Okay. Th-thanks" and with that he ran off toward the bathroom and I went to the living room to wait for him.

After a couple of minutes I heard the sound of flushing and shortly after Torts came into the room.

"I feel a whole lot better" he said as he sat down in a chair

"So what's your story there?" I asked him curious about how he ended up in that situation

"The same as yours from the other day. I had too much to drink last night and on the way here it caught up to me. I was going to go at home after breakfast but I got to thinking about all the fun we're going to have today and I forgot. I'm just glad I made it here in time" he told me

"Well now it's happened to both us" I said and we both laughed

We then enjoyed the day together

Here's a different version

I went to the phone and dialed the correct number.

"Hello" the mixel on the other end said

"Hello. My toilet has stopped working and I need to have it repaired" I replied

"Okay, we'll send someone over as soon as possible"

"Thanks" I said before hanging up.

"Okay. I should be able to hold it until he gets here" I assured myself

I decided to wait until after the toilet was repaired and I had relieved myself to have breakfast. I sat there and thought about what I was going to do to today while I waited.

After fifteen minutes of waiting I started to feel the pressure on bladder building up but I wasn't worried. After 30 minutes of waiting I started squirming in my seat.

"I hope he g-gets here s-soon" I said as I continued to hold it in.

After an hour had passed I reached my limit and my bladder was full. I didn't know long I would be able to hold on.

"Ohh. I don't think I can hold it much longer" I said as I struggled to hold it in.

Ten minutes later I felt another powerful wave of desperation and I couldn't wait any longer.

"I can't hold it in any longer! I need to go right now!"

I ran off to find somewhere to relieve myself. As I was searching the kitchen sink caught my attention. I remembered that there weren't any dishes in it.

"I-I'll just g-go in the s-sink. I c-can c-clean it afterwards" I decided

I began climbing up onto the counter so I could go in the sink. On the way up I felt another wave and a small stream of urine escaped me but I almost instantly regained control.

Once I was on top of the counter I quickly ran over to the sink. "F-finally. I c-can go n-now" I said as I reached the sink "I-it will p-probably be best i-if I s-stand inside the s-sink while I g-go"

So I carefully crawled into the sink doing my best keep from losing control. Once I was in the sink I went over to the drain and got into a good position. I then removed my tail from between my legs and started peeing. I sighed in relief as I finally allowed all my pent-up liquid to escape my bladder and flow into the sink and down the drain. I continued peeing for around two minutes before the stream began to die down into a trickle before stopping completely.

"I feel a whole lot better" I said to myself. I then cleaned up the sink. After I did I heard knocking on the door. "That must be him" I went and answered the door and was greeted by Torts.

"Hi Scorpi" he said

"Hi Torts"

"So your toilet is broken huh?"

"Yeah"

"Well I'll go have a look"

He quickly found the problem and started fixing it. It took him about ten minutes to repair the toilet .

"There you go. All fixed" he said

"Thanks. So how much do I owe you?"

"25 mucks"

"Okay" I went and got the 25 mucks and paid him

"Have a nice day Scorpi" he told me as he left

"You too" I then went to the kitchen to eat the cereal I got out earlier.

I would aprecciate it if you shared your thoughts and would really aprecciate it if you gave me some requests.

{{

I think the best part was the times being stated and how it made a bunch of mental images of Scorpi pop up. Also I like the second one better but thats personal preference about how I like desperation to end

Thanks.

3rd version

This story is about Scorpi and how he wet himself

It was late at night and I was watching a special late night episode of my favorite t.v. show. I was getting tired but I wanted to see the whole episode so I had been drinking pop hoping the sugar would keep me awake and it was working.

"Oh. I guess it's not a good idea to wait until after breakfast" I said

I was heading towards the bathroom when I remembered something. Last night the toilet stopped working for some reason. I had planned on having it repaired later on today but I was going to have to do it now.

I decided to wait until after the toilet was repaired and I had relieved myself to have breakfast. I sat there and thought about what I was going to do to today while I waited.

I got up and headed to the door. On the way there I felt another wave of desperation and I sprung a leak. I was able to stay in control and continued toward the door. Once I reached the door I quickly opened it and was greeted by Torts.

"Hi Scorpi" he said

"H-hi Torts"

He then quickly took notice of my desperation.

"Um, Scorpi. Are you okay?" He asked with a look of concern on his face.

"I-I had to m-much pop to drink l-last n-night and it finally c-caught up to m-me an h-hour ago" I told him

"Oh. Well don't worry I'll have your toilet fixed as soon as possible" he assured me

He quickly found the problem and started fixing it. Five minutes after he started fixing the toilet I reached my limit and my bladder was full. I wasn't sure if I could hold it in much longer.

"T-torts are you f-finished f-fixing the toilet yet?" I asked

"Almost. Hold on a little longer"

"I'll t-try"

Seven minutes after he started fixing the toilet I felt another powerful wave of desperation and despite my efforts to hold it in I lost control and the floodgates opened.

"Oh no"

"Is something wrong Scorpi?" He asked me as he turned towards me.

I just stood there embarrassed. Pee gushed out of me past my tail and ran down my legs and feet as a result before it reached the floor creating a puddle. My bladder continued to empty itself for about a minute before the stream died down into a trickle and finally stopped.

"I can't believe it" I said ashamed and embarrassed. The fact that Torts saw me wet myself only made it worse. "I'm sorry you had to see that Torts" he then walked to me and put a gooey hand on my shoulder.

"It's okay Scorpi. You had an accident it could happen to anyone. It's not your fault." He said in a comforting voice.

"Really?"

"Yeah I've heard about other Mixels wetting themselves"

"Okay I believe you"

"Well your toilet is fixed" he said

"So how much do I owe you?"

"Why don't you clean yourself up in the shower first before we take care of that?"

"Okay. I'll just clean up my accident first" but just as I was about to go get something to clean it up with he stopped me.

"No I'll clean it up for you. You just worry about getting yourself cleaned up"

"But Torts"

"I insist. It's what friends do"

"Okay. Thanks." And with that I went to get a towel and wash cloth while he went to get something to clean up my accident with.

When I got back with the towel and wash cloth I saw Torts cleaning up my accident. I walked past him and into the bathroom then got in the shower. As I cleaned myself off I couldn't help but feel ashamed and embarrassed. I had wet myself and right in front of Torts. I just couldn't believe it.

Once I was done cleaning myself off I got out of the shower and dried off. I then put the towel and wash cloth in the laundry basket and went to the living room where Torts was.

"You get yourself cleaned up?" He asked me as I entered the room

"Yeah" I told him looking down

"You okay Scorpi?"

"I'm just so embarrassed. So how much do I owe you?"

"You know what? Don't worry about it"

"Okay"

"You want me to stay here with you for a bit?" He asked me

"Sure"

"Okay"

We then went to the kitchen to eat breakfast.

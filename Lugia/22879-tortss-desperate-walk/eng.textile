This story is about Torts and how he almost wet himself

It was late at night and I was watching a late night movie. I was getting tired but I wanted to see the whole movie so I had been drinking pop hoping the sugar would keep me awake and it was working.

When the movie was over I had drunk three whole bottles of pop. I turned the tv off and got ready to go to sleep when I felt a small twinge in my bladder but didn't think it was anything to worry about.

(The next morning)

"(Yawns) that was a good movie last night" I said as I woke up and went to the kitchen to make breakfast.

As I was walking towards the kitchen I felt twinge my bladder like the one from last night but stronger.

"That stung a little. Oh well I'll go after breakfast" I said continuing towards the kitchen.

In the kitchen I decided to have toast for breakfast. I got out the bread and set the toaster to the right temperature. While I was waiting for the toast to get done I got out some peanut butter to put on it and poured a glass of orange juice. Once the toast was done I put the peanut butter on it and took it to the table with the once I finished the toast and orange juice I took everything to the sink so I could wash it later.

While I did that I started to think about all the fun Scorpi and I were going to have today and I was about to head out towards Scorpi's when I remembered that there was something I was going to do after breakfast.

"What was it I was going to do again?" I did my best to remember what I was going to do but I couldn't "Oh well. It's probably not that important" I told myself as I left for Scorpi's

After I was about a mile away from my house I felt a strong jolt in my bladder. I stopped as I remembered what I was going to do after breakfast.

"Oh that's right! I was going to go to the bathroom before I left" I said as I started feeling the pressure on my bladder "I'll just go when I get to Scorpi's" with my decision made I continued walking to Scorpi's house in the spiky desert

After I had walked another half mile the pressure on my bladder had increased and I had started squirming.

After walking for another half mile I came across a river. I tried to ignore it but couldn't because I could still hear the water. I ran in the direction I was going until I could no longer see or hear it because it was making my need worse.

"I just need to hold it in until I get to Scorpi's" I told myself

After I was 2 miles away from Scorpi's house I had to stop to bend over every once and a while.

Once I was a mile away from Scorpi's house I had to cross my legs and grab myself every time I felt a wave of desperation.

"I can hold it until I get to Scorpi's house" I assured myself

When I only had a half mile to go before reaching Scorpi's house I had to keep my legs crossed and my hands pressed against my bladder as I continued to hold it in. I knew that I was close to reaching my limit. And I wasn't so sure about being able to hold it until I got to Scorpi's anymore.

"I hope I can make it to Scorpi's house in time" I said as I felt another wave I desperation

After walking for another 15 minutes I finally arrived at Scorpi's house. By now I was at my limit and my bladder was full. I knew I wouldn't be able to hold it much longer.

"F-finally! I'm here" I said

I knocked on the door and shortly afterward the door opened and I was greeted by Scorpi

"Hi Torts" He said

"H-hi Scorpi" I replied

Just then he noticed my legs were crossed and my hands were pressed against my bladder

"Are you alright?" He asked me

"Y-yeah. Um c-can I use your b-bathroom?"

"Of course you can. When you're done come to the living room because that's where I'll be"

"Okay. Th-thanks" and with that I ran off toward the bathroom and he went to the living room to wait for me.

Just as I reached the bathroom I felt another powerful wave of desperation but was able to stay in control. I then went into the bathroom and closed the door.

"F-finally. I d-don't think I c-could've h-held it in any l-longer" I said glad that I could finally relieve myself

I went and stood in front of the toilet. I then moved my hands away from their position and started emptying my bladder. I sighed in relief as all the pee I had been holding in exited my body. I emptied my bladder for two minutes before I was finished. Once I was done I flushed the toilet and washed my hands before heading to the living room.

"I feel a whole lot better" I said as I sat down in a chair

"So what's your story there?" Scorpi asked

"The same as yours from the other day. I had too much to drink last night and on the way here it caught up to me. I was going to go at home after breakfast but I got to thinking about all the fun we're going to have today and I forgot. I'm just glad I made it here in time" I explained

"Well now it's happened to both us" he said and we both laughed

We then enjoyed the day together

Version 2

It was late at night and I was watching a late night movie. I was getting tired but I wanted to see the whole movie so I had been drinking pop hoping the sugar would keep me awake and it was working.

"I just need to hold it in until I get to Scorpi's" I told myself

After I was 2 miles away from Scorpi's house I had to stop to bend over every once and a while.

Once I was a mile away from Scorpi's house I had to cross my legs and grab myself every time I felt a wave of desperation.

"I can hold it until I get to Scorpi's house" I assured myself

When I only had a half mile to go before reaching Scorpi's house I had to keep my legs crossed and my hands pressed against my bladder as I continued to hold it in. I knew that I was close to reaching my limit. And I wasn't so sure about being able to hold it until I got to Scorpi's anymore.

"I h-hope I c-can m-make it to S-scorpi's house in t-time" I said as I felt another wave of desperation

After walking for another half mile I reached my limit and my bladder was full but I continued to Scorpi's house with the hope that I can make it in time.

"I-I d-don't have very f-far to g-go b-before I r-reach S-Scorpi's. I j-just need to h-hold it i-in a little l-longer." I told myself as my desperation continued.

Just as I was to continue towards Scorpi's a wave of desperation that is more powerful then the previous ones ran through my bladder. It told me that I wouldn't be able to make it to Scorpi's house in time.

"Ooohhhhh..... I w-won't be a-able to m-make to S-Scorpi's in time. Ugh! I can't take it! I need to go right now!" I said unable to deal with the desperation any longer. "But w-where do I g-go at?" I asked myself

Their aren't any port o pottys or public restrooms anywhere so I was going to have to go somewhere where I could hide so I could go without being seen. That would be hard since there aren't many places where I can hide well enough and there were a bunch of Mixels around too.

I looked around for anyplace where I could go. I was able to hide my desperation well enough that the Mixels wouldn't notice. I felt another powerful wave of desperation that caused me to leak a small stream of urine but I was able to stop the flow but I knew that it wouldn't be long before the floodgates opened

"Where can I go? Where can I go?"

I asked myself as I struggled to hold it in. Just then I noticed something "that huge bush over there will work perfectly!" I said excited by what I had found. The bush was big enough for me to hide behind I might even be able to hide inside of it. I went up to bush and then saw that it was big enough for me to hide in.

So I went inside the bush to see the inside "F-finally. I-I've found a p-place w-where I can g-go." I went over to an area that is easier to stand in,positioned myself, and started peeing. I sighed in relief as my bladder was being emptied and all the urine I had been holding in escaping my body and flowing onto the ground below. I continued peeing in sweet release for 2 minutes before the stream slowed down into a trickle then stopped. Once I was done I exited the bush and continued to Scorpi's

After walking for 7 and a half minutes I arrived at Scorpi's house

"I hope I haven't kept Scorpi waiting too long" I said as I knocked on the door .

Shortly after the door opened and I was greeted by Scorpi

"Hi Torts" he said

"Hi Scorpi" I replied "sorry if I kept you waiting"

"It's okay let's go to the living room and you can tell me about it"

"Okay"

And with that we both went to the living room. He sat down in one chair and I sat down in the other.

"So what's your story there?" Scorpi asked

"The same as yours from the other day. I had too much to drink last night and on the way here it caught up to me. I was going to go at home after breakfast but I got to thinking about all the fun we're going to have today and I forgot. I got to the point where I just couldn't deal with my desperation anymore so I peed in a bush" I explained

"Well now it's happened to both us" he said and we both laughed

We then enjoyed the day together

Here's another version I wrote for no real reason.

It was late at night and I was watching a late night movie. I was getting tired but I wanted to see the whole movie so I had been drinking pop hoping the sugar would keep me awake and it was working.

When the movie was over I had drunk three whole bottles of pop. I turned the tv off and got ready to go to sleep when I felt a small twinge in my bladder but didn't think it was anything to worry about.

"Where can I go? Where can I go?"

I asked myself as I struggled to hold it in. Ten seconds later I felt another powerful wave of desperation surge through my bladder and I knew I didn't have time to find someplace to hide. "Ohh.... I can't hold it in any longer! I'm just going to have to go here."

I was in an open area which meant that someone could see me. There were also a few Mixels near the area so chances are someone would see me going. I didn't care about that though, I just needed to pee badly and all I wanted to do was relieve myself.

Just then I saw a big rock "I-I th-think I'll just g-go on that r-rock instead of o-on the g-ground" I walked over to the rock, stood in front of it, and started peeing. I sighed in relief as my bladder was being emptied of all the urine I had been holding in as it was escaping my body and flowing onto the rock in front of me. I continued peeing in sweet release for 2 minutes before the stream slowed down into a trickle then stopped. Once I was done I saw that Wizwuz was the only one who saw me but he didn't care. I then continued to Scorpi's.

"I feel a whole lot better" I told myself

After walking for 7 and a half minutes I arrived at Scorpi's house

"I hope I haven't kept Scorpi waiting too long" I said as I knocked on the door .

Shortly after the door opened and I was greeted by Scorpi

I was going to go at home after breakfast but I got to thinking about all the fun we're going to have today and I forgot. I got to the point where I just couldn't deal with my desperation anymore so I looked around for a place where I could hide while I went but unfortunately couldn't find anything. So I ended up going on a rock right where everyone could see me. But thankfully they didn't." I explained

"Well now it's happened to both us" he said and we both laughed

We then enjoyed the day together

Slightly changed. This one has a hint to a future story

It was late at night and I was watching a late night movie. I was getting tired but I wanted to see the whole movie so I had been drinking pop hoping the sugar would keep me awake and it was working.

You know what? If you have any requests for mixels stories let me know.

*005*2014-10-19 03:59

Would someone please give me feedback about the story because I work hard and deserve that much.

{{

I. I enjoyed the variety. I like that you thought about different scenarios, and am glad that you shared them. In all of those alternate endings, it would've been nice to see one where tortes wet himself, as it got a liiiitle repetitive, but as it is it's a very cute project. Thank you for sharing

=)

I am planning one where he wets himself.

*009*2014-10-28 03:51

This story is about Torts and how he wet himself

It was late at night and I was watching a late night movie. I was getting tired but I wanted to see the whole movie so I had been drinking pop hoping the sugar would keep me awake and it was working.

When the movie was over I had drunk three whole bottles of pop. I turned the tv off and got ready to go to sleep when I felt a small twinge in my bladder but didn't think it was anything to worry about.

(The next morning)

"(Yawns) that was a good movie last night" I said as I woke up and went to the kitchen to make breakfast.

As I was walking towards the kitchen I felt twinge my bladder like the one from last night but stronger.

"That stung a little. Oh well I'll go after breakfast" I said continuing towards the kitchen.

In the kitchen I decided to have toast for breakfast. I got out the bread and set the toaster to the right temperature. While I was waiting for the toast to get done I got out some peanut butter to put on it and poured a glass of orange juice. Once the toast was done I put the peanut butter on it and took it to the table with the once I finished the toast and orange juice I took everything to the sink so I could wash it later.

While I did that I started to think about all the fun Scorpi and I were going to have today and I was about to head out towards Scorpi's when I remembered that there was something I was going to do after breakfast.

"What was it I was going to do again?" I did my best to remember what I was going to do but I couldn't "Oh well. It's probably not that important" I told myself as I left for Scorpi's

After I was about a mile away from my house I felt a strong jolt in my bladder. I stopped as I remembered what I was going to do after breakfast.

"Oh that's right! I was going to go to the bathroom before I left" I said as I started feeling the pressure on my bladder "I'll just go when I get to Scorpi's" with my decision made I continued walking to Scorpi's house in the spiky desert

After I had walked another half mile the pressure on my bladder had increased and I had started squirming.

After walking for another half mile I came across a river. I tried to ignore it but couldn't because I could still hear the water. I ran in the direction I was going until I could no longer see or hear it because it was making my need worse.

"I just need to hold it in until I get to Scorpi's" I told myself

After I was 2 miles away from Scorpi's house I had to stop to bend over every once and a while.

Once I was a mile away from Scorpi's house I had to cross my legs and grab myself every time I felt a wave of desperation.

"I can hold it until I get to Scorpi's house" I assured myself

When I only had a half mile to go before reaching Scorpi's house I had to keep my legs crossed and my hands pressed against my bladder as I continued to hold it in. I knew that I was close to reaching my limit. And I wasn't so sure about being able to hold it until I got to Scorpi's anymore.

"I h-hope I c-can m-make it to S-scorpi's house in t-time" I said as I felt another wave of desperation

After walking for another 15 minutes I finally arrived at Scorpi's house. By now I was at my limit and my bladder was full. I knew I wouldn't be able to hold it in much longer.

"F-finally! I'm here" I said

Just as I was about to knock on the door I felt another powerful wave of desperation and despite my efforts to hold it in the floodgates opened. Pee gushed out of me as my bladder emptied itself. It ran down my legs and feet before reaching the ground creating a puddle. I continued to soak myself for around one minute before the stream died down into a trickle and then stopped completely.

"And I was so close too."

After my bladder finished emptying itself I knocked on the door. I was so embarrassed that I almost didn't want to. Shortly afterward Scorpi opened the door.

"Hi Torts" he greeted

"Hi Scorpi" I replied

It was then that he noticed the puddle around my feet.

"Hey Torts why are you standing in a puddle?"

"Oh well um I.... I had an accident" I hesitantly told him

"Oh"

"Don't worry I'll clean it up"

"No it's fine I'll clean it up I don't mind. You can clean yourself up in the shower while I do if you want"

"Thanks Scorpi"

"It's what friends do. The towels and stuff are in the hall closet. I'll be waiting in the living room as soon as I'm done cleaning up your accident"

He then went to get something to clean up after me with while I went to take a shower.

I went to get a towel and wash cloth from the hall closet and headed to bathroom afterward. "I can't believe I wet myself and on Scorpi's front step of all places. I feel so ashamed" I said to myself as I walked towards the bathroom. Once I was in the bathroom I sat the towel down and got in the shower with the wash cloth. After I got the water to a good temperature I cleaned myself off. After I got out of the shower and dried off I put the towel and wash cloth in the laundry basket before going to the living room still embarrassed. When I got to the living room I sat down in a chair not far from the one Scorpj was in.

"So what happened there?" Scorpi asked

"Well I had too much to drink last night and on the way here it caught up to me. I was going to go at home after breakfast but I got to thinking about all the fun we're going to have today and I forgot. I was able to hold it in until I got here but just as I was about to knock on the door I lost control" I explained "I'm sorry"

"It's okay Torts. You had an accident it could happen to anyone" he said

"Yeah I guess you're right. Thanks Scorpi."

Even I had an accident I still enjoyed the day together with Scorpi.

I would appreciate it if you give me requests for Mixels omorashi story's so please give me your requests because it's not easy coming up with ideas on my own.

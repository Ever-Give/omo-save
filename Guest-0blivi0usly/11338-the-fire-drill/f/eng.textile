The Fire Drill

###

There was a sound in the halls as the lovely Irene Penny passed through the door. At 22 years old, She was 5'3" but with her shoes they made her 5'4" Long brown hair accompanied with green eyes made this woman absolutely stunning. Freckles dotted her nose and cheeks, and a casual skirt and sweater, combined to make her appearance that day. She stood in front of a classroom smiling softly as the rambunctious teen group of student in her home-room were busy goofing off...they never listened, and usually had a ploy if they did. She said "Good Morning Class!" A boy from the front row, Derek Wheeler, shouted "Shut up!"

She sighed...it was daily now...She wrote on the black board after setting her small coffee mug down on the coaster on her desk...With her back to the class and eyes on the board, kids slipped up to her desk and spiked her coffee with something they had been planning for months...They thought that teacher are on their high-horse and need to be removed from it...they couldn't have done anything that would have have hurt Mrs. Penny's feelings...so they decided to humiliate her instead. They spiked the coffee with a diuretic,,,well not one but 6 fast acting ones... Miss Penny turned around slowly to see kids scurrying back to their desks...She thought nothing of it since they were probably pulling another tack prank...

She swiped it off of the chair and as it had been a decoy for the other she said "The tack trick will not work on me children!" She sighed and giggled and kids did their acting job for the real start as Miss Penny took a big gulp of her coffee. Kids held back their laughter as a fire alarm went off and Miss Penny grabbed her coat and coffee for the cold weather. Kids packed their things as they had planned this...their friend had pulled the fire alarm. Miss Penny sighed leading the kids out as she felt a twinge in her bladder...She thought of it as nothing as she had been forced to hold it under worse conditions...

Marcus a 17 year old boy with a sort of admiration for desperation was getting all to excited to see this gorgeous woman go into a battle of her needs because he knew unlike his classmates that the fire department had to come, and that the closer fire department...was busy in main town at a office building fire...As they arrived outside the building[the building being very large and about 4 stories high] Miss Penny had the cold hit her thinly covered legs and shivered...If she had only known about this drill she thought regretting not reading the schedules...Marcus went over to her and he said "Hey, Miss Penny...you look great today." She smiled, Marcus had always been a sweet boy to her. Marcus smiled and deviously thought "this way I won't miss any action if I can just keep talking to her"

Marcus said "Those boys are really rude to you..." She said "They're just teenagers I suppose..." She sighed feeling another nudge from her bladder region...This time it was stronger. Miss Penny looked down to find her stomach quite swollen...She was a bit frightened as the principal approached her and she said "Irene, um there's a bit of a complication...this wasn't a drill." She looked at the principal and said "What does that mean..." The Principal, Mrs Tiller replied "The Fire department will have to come and to a clear search of the building...before letting us go back inside. We think a student pulled the fire alarm.

She hesitatingly sighed feeling another nudge from her abdomen, stronger than the first two and she said "How long will that take...?" The Principal said "Because of the fire inside town all of the close departments are taken so they're sending the closest one available ..sadly that's about an hour away from here considering our seclusion." Miss Penny sighed and She put a hand on her swollen abdomen and she said "Could i take a trip to the restroom quickly...?" She crossed her legs for the effect to convince the principal but she shook her head and replied "No One is allowed in the building...besides, you're an adult...you shouldn't have a problem waiting..."

She hesitated and looked over at Marcus who was getting quite a show from his prospective...His teacher's abdomen was distancing itself from her slim figure...She looked back down and thought "A conversation might help take my mind off of it..." She said "They're going to make us wait out here for hours...!" Marcus looked at his teacher and he said "well there is a huge fire inside town, and since this seemed to be some kind of hoax...i guess the county sees the fire bigger...She sighed at her bladder protested her opening her legs as it twinged giving off a warning...Miss penny was thinking of things to say when her mind wandered off into an unknown dimension... her bladder...If only she had gone before school started she thought...absent mindedly taking a sip of her coffee...she noticed she had finished it...

She looked at her distancing bladder and her stomach rumbled and suddenly a sharp twinge caused her to cross her legs again. "Shit" she thought as her eyes teared up out of pain...Marcus looked at his teacher and noticed something different...she looked about ready to cry...She was crossing her legs and he said as she let out a loud sniffle "Miss Penny are you al right " She hesitantly nodded and she said "I'm fine dear..." He sighed as she recovered and said to him " how was your Christmas this year?" He said "great. Your's?" She smiled at his considerateness and she said "it was okay..." She felt another strong urge in her bladder and she winced which Marcus saw perfectly. A hand hovered over her crotch area but then stopped and swayed to her side...She didn't want to jump to that yet...

Marcus noticed this clearly and He said nothing towards it...Miss Penny kept her legs crossed and she sighed... little did she know, she had been drugged for just this purpose...She kept hand on her midsection guarding it from rowdy student that were trifling about like crazed chimpanzees. Marcus also saw this and he said "you're really quiet miss..." She said "I feel a bit sick is all...nature sometimes does this to me...nothing to worry about..." A wave came over her and she double over and shoved her hands into her crotch and students started to laugh as they saw this... She said "go away!"

Marcus looked at his teacher and she sighed and Got up and crossed her legs immediately...She sniffled as a tear of humiliation rolled down her face and Marcus said "Miss You're crying..." She said "I...I'm sorry....ever-everyone was laughing at me and..." He said "You don't need to apologize miss..." She sniffled and Smiled a bit and she placed a hand on her mid section and Then a trouble maker Tyler Wells taunted her shouting out "Miss Penny's got to pee!!!!" Her face went red and she undid her crossed legs looking normally as her bladder protested and pain shot through her. She said "I'm fine...!"

Marcus sighed and he said "You don't seem to al right miss..." She shook her head and crossed her legs again and suddenly she felt this dead weight...She looked down to see the swell had grown much larger... as a wave hit her begging to release...She said "I'm afraid I might have a bit of a problem..." Her cheeks blushed red very bright and She got hit by another wave and She said "I have to use the facilities but they won't let me..." He knew that but she didn't know he did. He said "Oh...I'm sorry miss is there anything I can do to help...

She sniffled and said "I'm afraid not..." He said "So how long do you think the fire police'll get here?" She said "I don't know..." Her eyes got teary from the realization of what might happen...Marcus saw what happen and He said "Did I say something?" She shook her head and sat down as the rest of the class had already. The Jolt of sudden movement caused her bladder to leak and she grabbed her crotch stopping the flow. She had started crying and said to Marcus "I really need to go Marcus...!" He trying hard not to become erect at the desperation that was now on display.

She rocked to distract herself for the time being as Marcus stared at his teacher out of the corner of his eye and then dead on as he spoke "doing okay Miss?" She blushed embarrassed to come to this as another wave hit her and leaked again as she stopped it by the shoved of her hand...Marcus was hiding his erection from her. She sniffled and said "I wish they would hurry!..." Her bladder was definitely pushing her limits...She sniffled as she fluffed her skirt around her just encase and then continued to hold herself through her skirt as the only option. It had been about an hour at best and the diuretics were doing a toll on Miss Penny as her bladder was severely distancing from her figure now.

A boy walked up and sat by Miss Penny and She said "Please just leave me alone...!" She couldn't guard herself she was trying to hold on. in sudden movement the boy pushed on her swollen abdomen and She said "why would you do that?!!" As she rammed her hands deep into her crotch as they were the only things stopping the flow from coming...She was trying hard to regain control... Marcus put his coat over his lap as Miss Penny struggled and finally got herself back under control...her bladder now spasming frequently. She was now sitting on her heel as she sat there close to tears...

Marcus said "Look the fire department Miss Penny..." The Fire department pulled onto the street finally but they had to clear the large 4 story building and then she had to walk up 4 stories and then wait for the bell... With this thought she almost let go. She was rocking on her heel to keep herself from peeing..." Suddenly a spurt spasmed out of her bladder and hit the grass caused a splash and She started to cry again...Marcus went over to his teacher and hugged her from the side, feeling now his own slight urge to use the restroom...She said "I don't think I can hold it any more ..!"

She felt like just giving up and going to avoid all of the pain, The Fire department made their announcement as to the fact that they have to clear the building to ensure it's safe... Marcus looked at Miss Penny and she was lifting her hands away giving up and he gasped her herself and he said "Don't give up." She nodded shock as to where the boy had touched and she kept holding herself. She felt another spurt and could barely stop it...She shoved her hands in her skirt closing off the urethra and Marcus said "Miss...?" She said "It's the only way i can wait...!! I'm about to wet myself...!" He looked at his teacher and to tears out of pain and she said "ow..." She felt a spurt try to escape but failing and she knew she was safe for now...Marcus looked at his teacher and he said "Are you okay for now...?" She sniffled and Her bladder had grown to the size of a basket ball...

She said "How could this happen i just drank a cup of tea and coffee..." She sniffled and Marcus knew he had to tell her what the boys did..."Miss...my peers used the tack trick as not a prank but a decoy...what they really did was put 6 duiretic pills in your coffee..." She looked at her abdomen and tears filled her eyes, she started to cry...She got a hug from Marcus as she continued to cry...He was aware of the basket ball beteen them made of her urine...She said "They wanted me to humiliate myself...!" She then backed up and she said "You weren't part of it?" He said "I was asleep all last week remember." She sighed and her muscles relaxed and sheclamped at her crotch and she said "Oh god it's coming...! She closed herself off and Her eyes burned and the pain seered and she said "I will not humiliate myself...!" she closed off her muscles and braced herself...she didn't know if she could stand up when it was time...let alone remove her hand to walk properly...

She sighed as the fire department came out at the 2.5 hour mark and They said "The building's clear!" sighed as everyone got up and Marcus got up as well and He coaxed her up and she said "I-I-I can't..." He sighed and looked at his teacher. Her eyes were still teary and she was stuck on the grass. She sighed and she said "I'll end up...you know..." She looked down and then Marcus suddenly scooped her up in his arms and she still had a firm gasp to keep control...She gasped and said "You...you..." She wanted to hug him but she couldn't without drenching him and her...Marcus carried Miss Penny up the stairs as the bell rang and he dashed for the staffroom on the fourth floor. She whimpered as she was set down before the porcelain and he walked out as to not break rules more. Miss Penny was a few sits away from relief but she had a problem...how did she get her pants down...

She sighed and it appeared she had no choice..."Marcus" She called. He heard her and he said "are you decent?" She nodded and he walked in and she said "I have a problem..."He said "what is it?" She said "I can't take my hands away...I'll lose it..." She sniffled and she said "This is really embarrassing but could you help me...?"Her eyes welled up and he removed her Skirt leaving tight which he removed and the one layer he couldn't do...She said "Please I can't hold on much longer Marcus...!" She gasped with a spurt that shot quickly through her gasp and she clamped harder and she said "Oh god please!" He closed his eyes and shoved it down and turned around as he heard a stream cascade into the bowl and Miss Penny was shaking...

She sniffled wiping herself off as she got up...her panties were still damp from her leaks and she sniffled and she said "will they try this again...?" She questioned as she pulled up her garments. She sniffled and sighed as the bell rang. This boy had helped her through this and even carried her up 4 stories worth of stairs...She flushed and He sighed "...Miss Penny was and is beautiful..." he thought... She said "decent..." He turned around and she was washing her hands and she sniffled as her heart felt a pang of sadness knowing they'd have to part... The pain was so strong, stranger then the urge was in the bladder before she was relieved...

She started to cry while washing her hands but stayed silent to keep it discreet as she splashed her face and they crashed down...He sighed noticing she had washed her hands for a long time...he felt a strange feeling towards this woman...Her eyes looked sad and he said "Miss is there something wrong...?" She sniffled and her hand was on her heart...she felt a sinking feeling. The feeling was knowing she is not allowed to love who she already loves...She loved him...He loved her...but...they were restricted...

Chapter 6

She had trouble holding back tears as she walked to her clasroom...Her students were running rampid. She sat in a chair at the front of the room. She said "Please...! I need you to pay attention! This is third period english...! You freshman need lessons...!"

Marcus was walking to the library...he had a free period this term...He thought it over...he knew he loved her...but what could he do...? He lived alone, so maybe he could invite her over, or ask for a cup of coffee with her...She was barely older than him 5 years difference, his parents had been 12 years apart. He didn't know but Miss Irene Penny was about to burst into tears in front of her kids because she had the restrictions forcing her to refuse him even though it broke her heart...

Miss penny had given up on getting her class to listen and walked to the back where her desk is and she sat down facing away from all of the students. She removed her unrimmmed glasses from her face and the tears crashed down...Forgetting to limit herself she started sobbing into her hands and she couldn't stop... the pain was too much as the teacher lost control of her emotions over heartbreak...Kids looked up from their rowdiness to hear her loud sobs and gasps and a girl went back to her after consulting the group. all she could see was the back of Miss Penny's head.

The Girl said "Miss We're sorry. We promise to listen." She forced herself silent for her class and she sniffled and she said "I apologixe...that wasn't professional of me..." She walked up to the front of the room tears stifled...but an obvious tear reddened face...She said "Today...we...we're going to take a vocabulary test..." A tear leaked from her eye and she wiped it away quickly and she fixed with the projecter...It turned on and student grabbed out their own sheet of paper without her having to ask...She said "It's the unit 5 test...all you have to do is use the ten words in a sentence, and then define them and the way you used it..." She said "I'll have to ask that all of you clear your desks..." She wiped a tear from her eyes and she said "It's alright class...you'll do great."

Marcus went to school the library and researched things about love and what he should doi about it, he got out a piece of paper to write things down on and found himself writing Irene on the paper. They were accompanied by little hearts....he had falled for her bad...He printed some pages out and put them in his english book for safekeeping. He had to be the best for her, because that is what she diserved

Indentation is a bitch on omorashi.org. You have to space it five times every time you want to indent. I just went and did that for a big ass chapter and it took at least five minutes. Omorashi.org doesn't have indentation and double spacing, otherwise, I would totally use it.

Thank you for pointing it out...my laziness be damned

She was sitting in the back of her classroom trying not to cry this period away as her students were actually complying...She couldn't help it as a tear or two slipped whenever a student called her Miss Like Marcus did...They simply handed her a tissue and she nodded and took it. She felt a fimiliar twinge from her bladder and sighed, ignoring it. When the bell rang, She got a sinking feeling...Junior's English...Marcus was in this class...She stood up front trying to stay appearing happy.

He looked at her and He smiled and walked up to her, He said "I bet you're feeling better." She nodded and walked back to her desk feeling another twinge...Seeing him made her happy and sad. Just his prescence brightened her day and the pain just came emenser as he got closer to her...nicer, it all hurt but brightened at once. She sighed as she searched to think about something different...there was only one other thing she could find. She looked down at her origannly flat abdomen which was now swollen just a bit. The moment her mind thought about it was the moment she had to cross her legs.

She said to the class"Marcus, I'm going to leave you in charge as i have to take care of something for a moment." She walked over to the staff restrooms. Trying the knob it wouldn't turn and she knocked on it...There was snickering and she said "whose in there?!" She smelt a hint of smoke and she sighed, kids were smoking in there. She looked down at her swollen abdomen and it was more distant than before. She said "Kids, I won't report you if you just let me use the restroom." They shouted "Fuck off..." She felt herself get teary eyed and she decided to win them over and allowed her tears to come...She said a tearful "Please...my class...They...i can't explain...but im standing in the middle of the hall in tears...

If the principal sees me she'll have my head...please..." The kids sighed and a girl from her previous class came out and saw her teacher. She said "Miss Penny...!" She gave her teacher a hug andShe beared the grasp on her abdomen She squeezed tighter and she said "thanks for letting me...but I must hide before the principal finds me again, she gave me a verbal bruising. She sniffled and dashed into the staff restroom and sniffled and crashed on the bowl...The pain was too much...She was wailing and she couldn't help it...The intercom buzzed in and said "Irene Penny will you please come to the office? Irene Penny" She tried to get up but her legs wouldn't allow her...

The intercom kept buzzing and She just cried harder...Soon the principal herself went looking For Miss Penny. Miss Penny had finally managed to get up and start heading to the office when the principal found her...She was shocked to see her like this...She took her to her office and let her cry it out while sharing a few moments herself...After school Miss Penny was in her room packing up her things when Marcus walked in. He said "Miss would you like to buy a cup of coffee with me?" her heart skipped a beat when she heard this but she knew she couldn't...another pang hit her in the heart and her eyes welled up...She looked at him and he said "Is that what's been hurting you,,," She sniffled and She said "Legally I can't..." She sniffled and a tear fell. He dropped his bag and walked over to her...He said "please...stop torturing yourself..."

Hey Guys :)

I have had this idea for a while and just wanted to see if it interest anyone else before I make my own contribution. I have always thought it would be cool if we picked a desperation clip ( A really desperation one would probably fit the best) and right a story about it. Either using it as inspiration for the story, or actually righting a story about how the desperate person got into their situation or maybe a POV story.

As an example if there was a clip of a lady running into a toilet desperate you could right a story about her day and how she became that desperate, or what she was thinking as she ran into the toilet.

So anyway just an idea let me know what you think and I will contribute my story and video if it is a good idea :)

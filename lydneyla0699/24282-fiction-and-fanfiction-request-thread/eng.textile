So..basically, you guys can tell me if there is any specific story/fic/fanfic you want me to write. It can be either with existing characters or just random ones.

Ill post the stories on another topic.

P.S : doing male omo stories only, sorry.

I'm familiar with lots of characters , so you can ask for omo stories from pretty much any fandom (especially anime and book character fandoms) , and if i dont know the fandom, i'll check it out and do my best on the story <3

Though, there might be times when i might not do the story, either because i am unfamiliar with the characters or other reasons. most of the time tho, i'll probably do them.

So yeah, just reply to this topic with a request, and i'll do my best.

Maybe Ben from Ben 10? The only other story I've seen of him was one that was too sexual. I'd rather not see a sexual relationship develop between anyone, especially between Ben and Gwen.

I love ben 10 ! i'd be fun to write a omo fic on him :)

Is there anything specific you want in the story, or a certain age you'd prefer him to be during the story?

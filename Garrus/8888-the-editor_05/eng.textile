Glad your calibrations were successful. It hasn't made me any less eager to see more... Can't wait for the next part! And thanks again for writing such an interesting story in such excellent quality.

A-a-lot of calibrations (-_-;)

Very true, thank you. Not dead, just slow. Will come back when he's ready. Sorry, and thank you for your continued interest and support.

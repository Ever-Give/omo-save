Daughter of Snape

Chapter one: The start of school

Kayley Maria Snape, daughter to one Severus Snape, Potions Master of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was currently standing in Diagon Alley with her list of equptment for her first year which consisted of, plain black robes, a pointed hat, dragon hyde gloves and a winter clock under uniform, that would be easy. Books, Standard Book Of Spells. (Grade 1), A History Of Magic,Magical Theory, A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration, One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, Magical Drafts and Potions, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection. And other equipment included the basics 1 Wand, 1 Cauldron (pewter, standard size 2), 1 set of glass or crystal phials, 1 telescope and 1 set of brass scales. Just looking at the list was dizzying to say the least it would be a long day, thankful it was only mid morning they could get some shopping done then have lunch before finishing the day ith more shopping.

So far the day was good and they were making good time, unbeknownst to Severus his daughter was hiding something.

Half the list was completed and I was glad it was nearly lunch time sitting down would be a much needed relief on my feel, I was starting to feel a little unwell from rushing around and not having eaten much today. I looked up to the clock as we walked past, 12.52 it read, not feeling like walking more now I breath deep before voicing "Dad, Can we please stop for lunch?"

Glancing at the clock Severus nodded and headed towards The Three Broomsticks, sitting down and looking at the menu. I didn't need to look the choices were somewhat limited and I had a good idea what I could eat. "Right" Said Dad looking toward and I nodded before replying "I'd like a glass of Diet Lemonade, no ice and a slice of Lemon with the Wild Mushroom and Walnut Pasta Please"

Time seemed to slow as our food seemed to be on a delay, I had nearly finished my first drink although I knew I shouldn't drink too fast, I was just about to excuse myself as the waitress came over with our food, not feeling able to eat with an uncomfortable feeling in my tummy I ask anyway "Dad, could I please be excused?"

Glancing up from his dinner he breifly contemplated saying yes before realising his daughter has missed her morning snack so shaking his head he replies "Eat your dinner first please" Feeling deflated, I wasn't going to enjoy this one bit and I really did like this recipee so with a sad and annoyed look on my face I force down a few forkfulls before I really can't and look up to my dad watching me intently, I turn my sad eyes on looking straight back at his eyes "Dad please, I really need to be excused" Against all his instincts he nods to me and I eagerly exit the table and rush to the ladies, diving into the first cubicle I throw up none to kindly into the toilet bowl, when I'm done taking care of things I feel considerable better and rinse my mouth out in the sink before ashing my hands and returning to eating my lunch.

After the mishap around dinner, we continued our shopping and made one last stop in honeydukes sweet shop, I loved coming here and I would sometimes get free sweets off the owner as he remembered when I was young sometimes giving him a good laugh it made his day. I picked up some sugar free blood lolly pops, they tasted good, adding to my order I picked out some cauldron cakes, chocolate frogs, crystalised pinapples, ice mice, liquorice wands and bertie botts every flavoured beans all of which was sugar free and ordered especialy for me, the orders used to be small however to my surprise dad had ordered nearly 8 months suply for me but I didn't say anything and the charge was the same as usual perhaps there was a mistake, I was too tired right now though and would check over tomorrow before we headed to the school.

Chapter two: A day of waiting

It was now the first of September, the day school started, we had arrived at Hogwarts the night before so my Dad could organise what he needed to, I was still feeling quite unwell but I had no intention what so ever of saying anything, I knew for the most part it probably just nerves.

I was sat in my father's chambers while the morning seemed to drag like never before, I had organised all I would need for my first year, all packed ready to go to where I would be staying for the year although I knew and had been told I could stay here if I felt too uncomfortable where I was put, thinking of uncomfortable it suddenly sprang to my mind that I was bursting for a wee.

Slowly getting up considering how desperate I had let myself get, I hadn't meant to, I could hear my Dad speaking to someone as I walked past the kitchen, being completely unlucky today I'm called, considering ignoring my father and deciding against it, if he was in a foul mood everyone would suffer. Stepping into the kitchen I see my father and a quite tall man with fair hair, I didn't remember him for the years before I had spent growing up around the castle, it wasn't unusual to have new teachers though. "Kayley this is Remus Lupin, he will be the Defence against the Dark Arts Professor this year" Keeping a polite face I smile and reply "It's very nice to meet you sir" he smiles back and bows his head to me, it makes me want to smile I mean really smile but I think it comes across more as a grimace, they both look at each other, back to me then my father voices "Kay are you all-right?"

I nod trying not to move to much and I can tell they are trying to figure out what's wrong, my bladder gives a very insistent pulse making me cringe. "Can I please be excused?" I sound as urgent as I can, my father nods unwillingly and I dive down the hall to the bathroom, swinging the door shut which makes it slam, I silently curse myself having not wanted to bring any attention to myself but with the slamming door I definitely would have, ripping my trousers and underwear down I just barely sit on the toilet in time for a hard forceful stream to exit me, feeling pain in my tummy, I moan aloud and lean forward waiting for it to end.

What felt like forever later I finally finished, cleaning up, I splash some water on my face after I wash my hands the exertion from that ordeal had put a strain on me, I slowly make my way back to the lounge thankful I'm not called again, curling up on the sofa hoping for sleep to burn some time, dinner wasn't until 5pm when all the other student's would arrive.

4.45pm came and I was as nervous as ever, I even started to feel a little sick, waiting with the other first years really stressful, I felt like a little kid. Walking into the hall I felt a twinge in my tummy and hated myself for not taking care of my needs first, this made me feel even more nervous. Everything was going by in a haze I was blanking things, the only thing I took note of was being called and where I was placed, Dad would be pleased I got Slytherin.

Chapter three: first day of lessons

Waking up wasn't a hard routine with Severus Snape as a father I was use to a hard schedule and I had a bad feeling this would be the only easy thing for me today, as I stood in front of the bathroom mirror brushing my teeth memories from last night suddenly flooded my mind.

The sorting, the speeches the constant uncomfortable feeling I could no longer bear, everyone eyeing me as I got up from the table and ran from the great hall, barely making it to the bathrooms on time, feeling exhausted and in slight pain from the exertion then finally leaving the bathroom and walking dead on into my father, a serious look on his face, his arms crossed over his chest. He was mad. Looking him in the eye I dared him to start yelling, well yelling being an exaggeration, raising his voice was a better way of putting it. Waiting for the onslaught, however the conversation started calmly.

"Kayley, just what do you think your doing, noone is permitted to leave the sorting meal unless there is an absolute reason" staying calm myself I look him in the eye and tell a little lie although right now I thought I might be. "I am sorry Dad but I had no choice, I couldn't stand it any longer, I was so nervous tonight my whole body was in overdrive, I really needed to use the bathroom which I was hanging on for until we were released for the evening but I also felt sick and my tummy started clenching I knew I had to get out of there unless I wanted to disgrace myself in front of the whole school" .

I stood waiting for his reaction which clearly he was contemplating, his face slowly and very slowly went from anger to blankness and finally to concern, I was never sick well never may not be true but very rarely, he knew my bladder would get over-active when I was nervous or scared but he never knew me to be ill over it. In the end, he just nodded to me leading me back to the great hall to face the anger of all the other teacher's'

I groaned to myself wondering why I couldn't have just sucked it up and pushed through my personal torture, instead I ended up with detention tonight with two of the staff, I signed thinking it was only my first day and already I was in trouble, I finished my morning routines and headed up to breakfast and to receive my timetable for the year.

Breakfast was unusually noisy compared to what I was used to, I sat looking at my timetable which I had just received while nibbling on some toast, today would be a bummer, to start double potions with Dad, then double Transfiguration with Sirius Black and to end the day Defence Against the Dart Arts with Remus Lupin. I sighed packing my timetable in my bag and finishing my breakfast.

Standing in the dungeons I didn't feel uncomfortable after all I had spent most of my life down here which thinking about it now was a really sad thing to think. The door to the classroom opened directly on the bell for the start of class, I suddenly felt a spike of nerves and wished I hadn't, I didn't know why but just the thought of being nervous with my Dad teaching me made me a little scared too. I took my seat and waited for instruction.

I had seen the strict side to my Dad growing up but Severus Snape strict Dad was completely different to Severus Snape strict teacher, so many rules, No messing about in class, No talking unless your told you can, No getting up without permission and the most stressed rule NO leaving during a lesson unless the reason is absolute. All through the stressing of that rule I could feel my bladder twinging in protest the whole time, putting it to the back of my mind and hoping I could last the three hours concentrated on the task set, which was one copying the rules off the board and writing all the potions ingredients listed on the board and it properties in the front of out books.

The rules were no problem writing down and I had got half way through the ingredients list when I felt a different sort of twinge in my tummy which I didn't recognise, admittedly I did still feel a little sick but I knew it wasn't that, ignoring that too I carry writing but a little slower than normal due to actually feeling unwell.

As I'm writing I open up my mind to my father, but before I even send a silent message he can feel me and immediately sends ' you should be working young lady' feeling gob-smacked I start to withdraw but suddenly feeling a sickening cramp I stay just slightly 'Did you need something Kayley?' Looking up from my work I see him watching me 'Your pale' without thinking I look down at myself then feeling stupid I look back to him I reply 'My tummy is hurting' For just a second you could see the concern on his face 'Do you need to use the toilet?'

I look back down at my work and continue writing while reply 'I went before class' I shift slightly as pain spikes in my tummy and I can't help thinking I need to get out of here. "Miss Snape my office please now" I leave my desk and enter my Dad's office a little unwillingly. Staying stood and a little shifty, he floo's Poppy Pomfrey the school nurse who immediately steps out of the fireplace, walking over to me she leans her hand on my forehead and smiles at me. "Hey there Sweetie, can you tell me where it hurts?" In response I just place my hand over the lower right side of my tummy which in response my bladder spikes again rather urgently, leaning up to the nurse in question I whisper in her ear "I really need a wee too" She nods knowingly and summons a sample jar. Looking to Dad she speaks to him.

"Severus can you please give your daughter permission to give me a urine sample, from where the pain is I think it could just be a water infection which we could clear up in no time but I'll need a sample to confirm the diagnosis" Nodding to her in response, the concern visible on his face now, he looks toward me and walks over saying as he comes to a stop in front of me "Kayley do you think you can give Poppy a wee sample for me, it may help her to make you better"

I nod to him, tears forming in my eyes, I took the sample jar from Poppy and went to the bathroom in the office. Taking care to empty properly, I clean myself up and exit passing the sample back to Poppy who nodded and insisted she would return in five minuets. We both returned to class while we waited for the news, Poppy never returned and the end of class was soon upon us, everyone was dismissed but I lingered and when everyone was gone without even asking I went into the office bathroom and used the facilities, my tummy had started to hurt again a little while ago.

Break had been far too short and we were now in Transfigurations with Sirius Black. Wishing I could just curl up in bed I forced myself to pay attention to the lesson, I made it to two hours and fifteen minuets before I couldn't take the pain in my tummy any longer, approaching the teacher, I was so sure he would say no but seeing my expression upon waiting for him to ask me what I wanted, the first words however out of his mouth were "Do you need to leave the class" I just stay looking at him for a minuet before responding "Yes sir" He nods and hands me a bathroom pass which I take gratefully and rush from the room desperate for relief. Upon returning to class Professor Black looked relieved to see I now looked content again, I finished the class with no more problems until I was called to stay back a the end of class, It was now lunch time and I was really hoping to catch Poppy to find out what the problem was. I wait patiently while the classroom clears.

Once the door closes, Sirius Black casts a privacy charm incase anyone was to come in. "Now Miss Snape, would you like to tell me why you waited so long to come to me in class today" Thinking of only one possible thing which actually was also the truth I respond "I'm sorry sir, I'm not used to it at the moment . . .. " out the corner of my eye I notice the door open and Professor Lupin enter the room but continue ". . . I saw Poppy this morning and she thinks I might have an infection which is making me need the bathroom a lot more, I really thought I could wait but then it started hurting, It won't happen again sir I promise"

He gives me a sympathetic look replying "Well see that it doesn't please, when do you get your results?" feeling like a child again with these questions "I'm off to see Poppy for them when we are finished here sir" a pain in my tummy makes me give a grimace, Sirius Black takes down the privacy charm and says to me go on then please" I get off the table I had been sitting on and give a hiss of pain drawing the attention of them I bolt from the class before I'm kept any longer.

By the end of lunch I had my results, it was a quite nasty water infection with traces of blood in which would heal in no time now I had started the medication, not really feeling like going to the last class I drag myself to the bathroom for relief before the hour and a half lesson which I hoped would be no problem although my nerves were acting up again, Remus Lupin had heard the hiss of pain I gave at the beginning of lunch, I was given a Nurse's office pass and a Bathroom pass but I didn't want to use them in front of everyone. Taking my seat in DADA I really felt uncomfortable which for me definitely was not good.

Again as I feared my bladder pulsed inside of me after only half an hour of class still an hour to go, oh yeah and then two detentions on after the other fantastic. I felt tears prickly my eyes as the worst pain yet struck me, Poppy did say it was likely to get worse before it got better, I grit my teeth trough the pain and continued my work as best I could, after only another ten minuets I had stopped myself breathing some to ease the pain, I couldn't stay in this class, I now knew what the Nurse's pass was for, she thought I wouldn't make it through class, for just that alone I wanted to prove I could but the pain made me want to scream, getting up made the pain easier, maybe if I just asked to go to the bathroom it would help, walking up to the desk that sat at the front of the class, Remus Lupin greeted me with a smile as he usually did asking me "Hey Kayl, how can I help you today?"

Ungritting my teeth and taking a slow breath I respond "Could I please go to the bathroom Professor?" I can see his brow wrinkle slightly and I bend sightly at the waist as the pain gets worse again I carefully cross my legs really hoping he will say yes. "Is it really necessary, class is nearly over after all" I grit my teeth again and ground out in response "Yes sir, it is really necessary" I can see he really doesn't look convinced which isn't helping my predicament at all, he studdies me carefully, neither of us saying a thing then it suddenly occurs to me, he's a wolf, his sense of smell is enhances, knowing if I let just a little out it would help the pain but for the most part he would only smell the blood, leaning further slightly putting extra pressure on my bladder, a few drops leak out easily, the pain worsened as I fort to keep it to just a few drops.

I speak again "Sir please it is an emergency" by his expression I know he's smelt it and hands me a pass and to everyone's surprise I just disappear right from where I stood, blinking to the bathroom saved time, I tend to my bladder, the pain is still there but not as strong, I can cope with it, I blink the pass back to his desk as I blink straight to my seat finishing my work, I didn't stick around at the end of class but bolted for the dormitory to change, I put on my black button down corset dress with a purple lace cardigan, detention wasn't for an hour yet so I could be myself at least for now.

Time had really ticked by I just made it in time to get my next dose of medication, then unfortunately it was time to attend detention with Professor Black, not feeling too bad I by pass the toilets not realising now I would soon regret that move over the next three hours. The door was open upon my arrival and I tap twice drawing the attention of both Professors in the room, Professor Black indicates I take a seat, I do and wait but as I sit my bladder twinges and I curse under my breath causing them to look up and walk around the desk, I groan inwardly. I'm looking at Sirius "What was that?" his lips never moved, I look to Remus who is waiting for an answer "Nothing sir" I cross my legs under the table as Remus looks stern "Didn't sound like nothing" Looking down I just reply "Sorry Sir" another voice enters the conversation from the doorway "Sorry could I have a word with Kayley Please?" I knew that voice anywhere Dad.

Sirius nods, I get up and come to the door "How are you feeling?" I look down "Fine" he clears his throat causing me to look up "I've spoken to Poppy" Looking to the sides the finally down I reply "It hurts but it's manageable but I forgot to use the bathroom and uh the pain caused me to curse when I sat down which is why I was getting questioned, I didn't mean to it just really hurt" I grimace as pain shoots I look to the side where both Remus and Sirius are watching me, I turn my head the other way, bathrooms, without a word I dart to the bathrooms to relieve myself of both my bladder and my stomach contents, I feel hot and I'm finding it hard to breath, the bathroom door opens and my Dad comes to me "It's ok Sweetie lets go take care of you, I'm picked up and taken to his chambers that's the last I remember as I rest my head on his shoulder, just enough time to think bloody brilliant first day!

Chapter four: Fighting the infection

All I could think was 'it's too hot' I couldn't comprehend why, I really didn't feel myself, my tummy hurt, almost felt like it was a deep burning sensation inside which made it hard to breath, I lay on my bed trying to get comfortable knowing to stay where I was as told by my Dad. I reach over to the side table and take a sip from my glass of water, it felt cold and soothing on my too warm throat, feeling a little comforted by this I lay back on my bed and let the darkness take me.

Jolting suddenly awake, my bladder is pulsing, my tummy aches with need, I know if I move it will alert my Dad if he doesn't already know, I don't like the attention, some good rest and the right medicine will sort me out. Feeling absolutely bursting for a wee, I get up from the bed hit with a wave of dizziness, grabbing the bedside table with one hand and my crotch with the other, all I could fee was desperation, I could feel perspiration on my neck and shoulders, dragging breath steadily into my lungs trying to calm myself, I had to make it to the toilet before it was too late however my current situation was making it hard to think or even focus, tears began to fall down my cheeks against my will, taking another deep breath I make it slowly to my bedroom door before having to pause again almost losing control, leaning heavily on the door breathing steadily I heard voices down the hall probably coming from the kitchen.

I open my door cautiously looking around the frame I see my Dad dart into view looking concerned, he politely excuses himself from whom ever is accompanied by and comes to my side. "Kayley are you alright?" His question only brings more tears to my eyes and I shake my head regretting the action as more dizziness hits me. Dad's concern grew asking "What is it? Can I help Sweetie?" Feeling ready to crumble down in tears and in agony I nod my head slowly and whisper rather croaky "I really need a wee and right this second" Fully opening my door he see's my hand tucked into my crouch. Very gently I'm picked up and rushed to the bathroom and he swiftly leaves to let me take care of my needs by myself.

I hardly remember much from the last few days except pain and a lingering feeling of being over warm.

(Sorry guys Chapter will be continued at a later date my little man is poorly and needs me right now)

The Girl

I had made friends with Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger, Luke Winchester and Fred and George Weasley are kind of friends, I also became Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team with Captain Oliver Wood who has been helping me to train. I love Quidditch but someone had caught my eye, not in the I’m attracted to you way but in the something is wrong with her way, she is the back up Seeker incase I get sick or couldn’t play a Quidditch game for any reason so she is at practices with us but never really joins in, she stays quiet and stays distant, it makes me wonder if she is sick.

Later that evening in the Gryffindor Common Room me, Ron, Hermione and Luke sat down to complete homework as usual but Luke kept watching the door, both me and Ron noticed and when the person he was waiting for entered he was straight up and talking to her, I still didn’t know her name, this was quite annoying, if I told someone she might be sick who would I tell? And who would I say it was? Luke had a helping hand in this when he introduced her as Kayley, no surname but Kayley, I had a 1st name, good enough to start with. Over the next few weeks she opened up, not as shy, not as quiet but she still seemed unwell, always quiet in classes, withdrawn in Quidditch practices, late to meals, it wasn’t until 1 Potions class things started to make sense to me, an older boy with a note for Professor Snape came in.

“Miss. Lupin, your presence has been requested immediately in Professor Black‘s Transfigurations classroom.”

Was the boom of Snape’s voice, he didn’t sound pleased, he doesn’t like any interruptions in his classes, not even for bathroom requests. To my astonishment, Kayley got up and replied

“Yes Professor”

Then left the class. There was so much going through my head, Kayley was Kayley James-Lupin, I had heard her name mentioned by Remus before but I never knew he ment her, always late to meals, Remus was too, the feeling or rather looking unwell didn’t fit yet, other things made sense though but why was she going to see Sirius and now of all times? I had no answer for that and to feel able to ask I would have to talk to her more and maybe she won’t feel as shy around me, it’s Quidditch practice tonight so maybe I could ask her to help me, or maybe a challenge to see who can get the snitch 1st? It had to be worth a try if nothing else.

Lunch came and went but Kayley, Luke, Remus or even Sirius never showed up to eat anything, I didn’t know what to think of that, Kayley maybe, Sirius and Remus, it wasn’t uncommon for a Professor to miss a meal but Luke no way he always ate no matter how little he ate, he would eat.

Double Transfigurations is down for now and we know that Professor McGonagall is unwell, there was a memo on the board this morning which means Sirius or rather Professor Black should be teaching, maybe I could see him after class. Time is actually being cut quite fine and if I do what I need to 1st I will be late for class and get in trouble that way, I could always wait until after class, no problem.

At Transfigurations, Kayley, Luke and Hermione were already in the class as well as some of the other students I didn’t know too well, Kayley looked pale and not just pale but pale enough to start looking green and she was sitting in a strange way I never saw her sit before, especially not in classes anyway. Transfigurations was nearly over by the time I was bursting to what I now really had to and I know I needed to speak to Sirius as well but Quidditch practice is so close, things seem so complicated right now and while all this is going around in my head Kayley looks right at me and it’s like I can hear her think ‘Harry, are you ok?’ but her lips didn’t move and no-one else heard her, I nearly wet myself right there so after the initial shock wore off, she was still looking at me so I look at her and think ‘I just need to use the bathroom that’s all’ Kayley smiles and I know she heard me but why was she smiling? How did she hear me? And then the answer came

‘So do I, that’s why I smiled but also you don’t have to look at me, I just looked at you so you knew it was me who was communicating with you, I have a gift to communicate through the mind with other people, it’s not too rare’ well I guess that seemed like an ok answer but ‘How come you never went to the bathroom at lunch?’ maybe she will talk a bit more now. ‘I would have done but Sirius . . Uh . . I mean Professor Black kept talking an the Remus . . Uh . .

Professor Lupin came in so by the time I could of gone I couldn’t because class was starting, I’m going to run off before Quidditch practice to take care of that, you probably should too so Ollie doesn’t get moody if you have to stop’ boy this girl knew how to talk, so quiet yet so loud at the same time, she gives me a weird sort of look as I think that and I realise ‘Oh My God, you can hear everything’ it was a statement not a question but she answers ‘Yes’ anyway, ‘I’m really sorry, I didn’t mean that it’s just I’ve been wanting to speak to you but you always seemed so quiet or distracted and I’m sorry’ she smiles and I feel stupid because she must of heard everything I have been thinking about her since well before we got introduced and time is going so slow, I really need to pay some attention to my bladder soon as it feels like it’s going to burst. ‘I did’ huh? Ok ‘You heard everything I thought about you?’

‘Yes, it was very sweet you would be concerned for me like that when you didn’t even know me, I’m not sick though thank you I feel fine apart from 1 thing’ aww that’s nice, anything to take my mind off of my growing problem but ‘If your not sick then why are you so pale?’ that seemed a weird question but she was and she was starting to look greener, ‘If I could laugh I would, I look so pale now because I didn’t eat or drink very much at lunch time and the pain in my bladder is making me feel a bit queasy’ well why doesn’t she just ask to go to the bathroom, I mean it’s Sirius, he’s nice ‘why don’t you ask he’s your godfather’ damn she really does hear everything, then a loud raised voice penetrates through my ears

“Mr. Potter, Miss. Lupin stay after class!”

Oh crap I cant stay after class I don’t even know if I can get to the end of class ‘calm down’ what the hell am I going to do? This can’t be happening, then I hear it again ‘Harry calm down’ It’s Kayley, she really is still communicating ‘I can’t’ is all I can think still panicked, I was going to wet my pants maybe even before the end of class, I am so dead.

‘Harry calm down, take a deep breath’ Kayley began again, how could I calm down I’m not visibly panicking so that should be fine right? ‘No, it’s not fine, it will make you feel worse and need to go more, anyway why didn’t you go at lunch?’ Oh great, like talking about it won’t make it worse either ‘Will you stop that, it’s annoying, I didn’t have time to go at lunch just like you didn’t’ maybe that will shut her up , the end of class was only half an hour now but that didn’t matter I couldn’t concentrate 1 bit and as I was after class, I may as well wee now. ‘I will not stop trying to help a friend but he is your Godfather so you have a better chance than I do of getting out plus I’m not panicking like you and I could wait another 2 hours if I have to’

‘2 hours!?’ she hears everything anyway I may as well not think 1st. ‘Actually thinking 1st can be good and you don’t have to wait 2 hours just ASK!’

‘Do you really think he would say yes?’

‘He could but you aren’t going to know until you ask’ with that thought I may as well, I had nothing to lose except maybe my dignity if he said no. ‘ASK!’

‘OK, OK’ I raised my hand hoping to not cause to much attention but I didn’t really care anymore, Sirius was with another student for the moment so he looked at me acknowledging I needed him so I put my hand down, Kayley turned to look at me and got told to turn back around, I think it’s the most she has communicated in 1 class maybe even the whole term and got told off by someone. It was bad enough now that I doubted my own ability to actually make it to the toilet and I was holding myself so I didn’t wee all over the floor, which I would probably do if no-one was around I was so desperate, Sirius finally came over to my table and lent on the edge, I was sat next to Ron so he eyed me suspiciously as well, I now knew I would not make it to the door let alone the toilet, the pain was so bad.

“Mr. Potter are you stuck?”

Not exactly,

“No Professor but”

I lean in to whisper in his ear

“I need to use the bathroom really really badly and I can’t concentrate on anything, the only thing stopping me from weeing is my hand and it really hurts now.”

I also feel very embarrassed having just told my Godfather that and he looks at me suspiciously but answers

“No you can wait until the end of class to go”

Everyone stopped to look at me I hated this but Kayley was talking again, ‘Wait until the end of class and I will use the spell on you so you don’t have to go, if you can’t wait that long tell Kayley to tell me’ leaving me slightly confused but I go to answer when I feel my hand get slightly wet, I squeeze tighter and cross my legs to stop the flow which works just, ‘NO I really really definitely can’t wait that long, I just weed a little and it really does hurt’ I feel like a baby whilst saying this but it was the truth, Ron beside me heard me whimper quietly from the pain

“Harry, What‘s wrong?”

Oh I just weed my pants a little that’s all

“Nothing Ron I‘m fine”

And I fake a smile but I know it looked more like a grimace, ‘Just wait another minuet then, I will dismiss class early to save you the embarrassment’ with that in mind I feel my bladder pulse inside me and let a little more wee out into my hands, I couldn’t stop the flow as easy this time as it hurt a lot to do so but I managed.

“Right class, we are finishing early today and I want you to do chapters 1 though 3 by next lesson and Professor McGonagall should be back by then. Mr. Potter, Miss. Lupin please stay behind”

Everyone had packed up by then but I noticed Luke wasn’t moving and that is when I realised he had heard everything, he was like Kayley, I felt sick to my stomach and I really did with the pain, speaking of Luke

“Professor could I please stay a moment? I feel a little sick”

I was actually hoping he would say no as I was in a lot of danger of making a puddle on the floor at any moment and it was bad enough Kayley knew what was going on for Merlin’s sake, ‘It’s ok I won’t tell anyone I just really do feel sick’ and that confirmed it he knew every thought since I was in that classroom I also now know what she ment by ‘so you would know it was me communicating with you’ I’m so stupid, Ron, Hermione and 2 other students other than Luke and Kayley were still packing up when I felt my bladder contract hard and a slow steady flow started to leak out of me, Kayley must have been listening in because next thing I knew was Sirius going

“Come on, Hurry up I don‘t have all day”

Which was quite a relief and as the door latched closed I started to splash the floor but I was still trying with all my might to stop it but it just wouldn’t then Kayley actually says

“Don‘t you‘ll hurt yourself, Sirius could you please give me a bathroom note?”

She called him Sirius, wow, thought only I did that.

“Could you just wait a moment please Kayley, I won‘t be a minuet”

The pain was unbearable now and I just moved my hand from between my legs which resulted in a loud splash hitting the floor because of what I was actually catching in my hands, everyone looked my way and I just laid my head on the table and continued to wee while Kayley shoved her hand up her skirt, I have just about enough sense to mumble

“I‘m sorry”

With that Remus enters the room, I could literally sick up now, my stomach was burning and it was slowly moving up my chest and my throat when

“Oh God, I‘m going to be sick!”

Both Luke and Kayley dived for the trash can while Sirius an Remus just stared at me, things couldn’t get any worse I had just weed myself in front of 2 professors and 2 students and I was about to sick up on my desk which I did because I really could not control that, ok I was worrying that Kayley was sick, now it looks like I’m sick, great.

Sirius and Remus helped me clean up, Kayley still hadn’t been excused, Luke had also been sick and we had to be at Quidditch practice in 10 minuets, the thought of just flying made me sick up again, I didn’t want to have to play Quidditch as well but also I felt for Kayley so I mumble

“Kayley needs a wee”

Sirius didn’t hear but Remus turns around to look at Kayley who was sat on the desk with 1 hand rubbing Luke’s back and 1 hand between her legs up her skirt

“Kayley, do you need to use the bathroom?”

She must have answered quietly because I didn’t hear, I just know I felt really sick and was actually about to sick up yet again.

Needless to say we never attended Quidditch practice that night, Luke was sick, he was actually the back up Keeker incase anything happened to Oliver, I was sick then Kayley started to feel sick so did Sirius and Remus, we are now all in the hospital wing getting treated for some virus that had been brought to the school and all the sickness actually hurt my stomach, there was also no need to say Oliver wasn’t happy but when he came to yell at us about not being at practice Kayley was actually sick for the 1st time, on Oliver, Madam Pomfrey sent him away with strict instructions about if he or anyone else in Gryffindor started to feel unwell.

While a week later we were all released from the hospital wing and feeling much better to carry on as it never happened.

With your trusty paper clip, you decide to try your luck at picking that lock. Sure, you're not an expert thief or anything, but locks like these are pretty simple and don't require a lot of effort. You unfold the implement and stick one of the ends into the lock.

Success! You hear a click come from inside of the box, and proceed to open it.

Inside of the box, you see:

- Twine

- Iron key

- Tinder box (10 uses)

- Stone plate with a water drop engraving

You then follow up on Emma's curiosity and check the cabinets.

Nothing particularly interesting in either of them. Between the two cabinets, you see:

- Lots of dinner plates

- Several cups

- A candle-holder with three slots

- A bottle of wine

- A hammer

- An empty glass jar

- A pitcher

Now you had to decide what you wanted to take with you. You open your inventory to see what you have to work with.

With five open slots, you can take up to five more items of reasonable size and weight with you. If there is nothing that appeals to you, you can proceed without taking any items.

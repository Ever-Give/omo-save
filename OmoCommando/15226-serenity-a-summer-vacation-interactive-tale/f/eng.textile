This story is sort of a spin-off of my previous story, The Wild Tempest. You will be following Isabel Lester once again as she tries to enjoy herself on this magnificent resort. Buuuuut, things never seem to go right for poor Isabel, especially when bathrooms are involved. It is up to you to guide her through the story and ensure she makes it out okay.

*side note: This story will be a lot more docile than Tempest was. You do not need to worry about character deaths.

(Everything in spoiler tags to keep the post small)

Rules and Pointers:

{{: 

1: The system will work a little differently this time. It will not be entirely combat based, and therefore will not utilize a standard health/HP system. It will instead focus more on a puzzle/mystery aspect (with desperation to match). On that note, “game overs” are very hard to come by (though they may still happen).

2: As stated before, the first poster will probably get priority as the used suggestion. The exceptions are:

A: If several people (at least 3 or more) agree on a post other than the first.

B: If I reaaaaally like another post.

C: The first post is beyond reason.

3: I encourage specific suggestions for this story. A vague suggestion such as “Use that item,” will often lead to undesirable consequences. Another thing that may help is to read the whole story segment before posting. Suggestions sound a lot better when they’re made by someone who’s aware of what’s going on (most people who post before reading the story often leave poor decisions anyway and I may just skip over them). If the first suggestion is too short, I will probably combine it with a more favorable one.

4. I will not save you from a poor decision. You are pretty much free to give whatever suggestion you please, though you may not get the outcome you intended.

5. As author and artist, I reserve the right to change story mechanics at anytime.

6. Keep an eye on this post. I will update it with important mechanics and current inventory.

Party Member Stats:

{{: 

Isabel’s Stats:

Appeal: 7

Shyness: 7

Stamina: 12

Holding: 7

Class: Soldier

Favorite Drink: Berry-flavored fruit juice

Weakened by: Spicy Food

Erika’s Stats:

Appeal: 4

Shyness: 8

Stamina: 8

Holding: 4

Class: Kid

Favorite Drink: Comet Cola

Afraid of: Spiders

}}

Explanation of stats:

{{: 

- Appeal: How attractive and persuasive the character is. The higher this number, the greater your chances of convincing someone to do something.

- Shyness: A character’s unwillingness to do certain actions. The higher this number, the greater the chance she won’t willingly do something potentially humiliating. (such as peeing on a building floor)

- Stamina: The characters’ capacity to stay awake and energized. When this value gets low, the character needs either rest or an energizing snack/meal/beverage. If it reaches 0, the character will pass out. Many factors affect stamina depletion, such as time in the sun, running, swimming, heavy lifting, or fighting.

- Holding: The stress threshold of a character’s bladder. A character with a low Holding stat can’t hold it for very long. The lower the stat, the quicker the desperation status will progress.

- Class: The character’s speciality. Indicates the general skill set. A soldier, for example, is a physically strong individual, where a merchant has great persuasive abilities. A kid, on the other hand, has an open, ready-to-learn mind. At some point in the story, they may become any class of character (their stats altering to accommodate the class)

- Favorite drink: The beverage of choice for the character. Metabolizes much faster than other drinks, recharging more stamina but filling the bladder more quickly.

- Weakness: A negative trait for the character; something they’re afraid of, can’t eat, or are just simply weakened by. (i.e: A character who’s afraid of spiders won’t use a bathroom with a spider in it)

}}

Current Inventory: (last update: June 29)

{{: 

- 250 credits

- Sun screen

- Tanning lotion

- Antiseptic

- Two energy bars (apple flavor)

- Two Juice boxes (wild berry)

- A Personal Communication Device

- Eye Shadow (blue-violet)

- Nail Polish (red-violet)

- Hairbrush

- Toothbrush

- Dental Floss

- 3 beach towels

Essential Items:

- Room 131 Key

- 7 pairs of panties (Isabel)

- 5 pairs of panties (Erika)

}}

Desperation Status: This is the rating of how badly a character needs to pee. As time passes and as drinks are consumed, this status will change between Fine, Has to go, Holding, Desperate, Bursting, and Danger! As this status gets closer to Danger!, the capacity to perform actions becomes limited (such as running speed). Once a character has reached “Has to go” status, she can pee at any time. Depending on the severity of the need and her shyness stat, she will go in certain locations.

- Fine: No urge to go is felt. Couldn’t pee if you tried.

- Has to go: An urge to pee is felt, but isn’t serious. Characters in this status will only go in a bathroom or appropriate facility.

- Holding: A more serious need to go. The urge is quite prominent, but still manageable. Characters in this status may pee outside discreetly.

- Desperate: Need to pee badly. Concentration breaks easily due to the severity of the urge. In addition to the previous status, characters in this status may pee inside a body of water, such as a swimming pool.

- Bursting: Nearing the breaking point, a hand is on the crotch nearly all the time, legs squeezed tightly together, occasional spurt. Character will likely pee anywhere outside and some places inside.

- Danger!: The point of leaking. Character is now moments away from an accident and, depending on her shyness, is likely willing to pee anywhere, possibly even in front of other people.

Panties: Panties are essential for any girl. You don’t question why or how, they just are and everyone knows it. Pee has a tendency to ruin a perfect pair of panties, however. If a character runs out of panties due to frequent wettings, she will have to go commando. A panty-less girl gets +2 to her shyness stat, her stamina will drain more quickly and future holding will become more difficult, but she will still be able to interact. As said before, each girl has a unique body and preference. She therefore cannot share or trade her panties with another girl. (this mechanic does not apply if a girl is wearing a bikini)

Lewdness/Explicit content: Depending on the path you choose for the characters, this story may contain some nudity and free peeing but nothing beyond that.

And with that, let the vacation begin!

==========

[June 22, 52nd year of Sagittarius]

You walk into your quarters and sigh. Command had just gotten done telling you you had to take a vacation, when you were clearly still fit for duty. But orders are orders, and the ship was close to a very nice vacation spot.

Yes, you are Isabel Lester, Captain of the Republic Commando squad known as Blue Team. A renowned soldier and fighter, you also have a reputation for being quite compassionate. You had just gotten back from a very hectic mission a few weeks ago, nearly losing a good friend. That was the most stress you had endured in a long while. Perhaps a vacation was in order.

You walk over to your dresser, trying to decide on-

Wait...

Your favorite book was on the floor. You knew better than to leave it there, you always put in away in the second drawer to the upper right. How did it get there? You walk over to pick it up when someone jumps on your back.

“Hiiiiii, Isabel!!!” Yells a high-pitched voice.

“Erika, get off!”

It was your little cousin. With your aunt and uncle away on business, no one was really available to take care of her but you.

She jumps off and sits on the bed.

“You promised you’d show me some cool things! I’m bored!”

You smile. This couldn’t have been timed better. “Well you’re in luck, Erika! I was just given a shuttle to go to a vacation spot of my choosing.”

The young girl’s eyes light up. “Where are we going to go?”

“I was thinking... Rolana.”

“The super resort planet? Wicked awesome!” she squeals.

“Pack your things, little cousin. We’re going to be gone for a good long while.”

___

[Clock set to Rolana planetary time. 0832 hours] (Planet has a 30 hour rotation period, 0000-2000 are considered "daylight" hours)

As you pilot the shuttle, you come upon the mainland. It’s breathtaking how many different landscapes and environments are on it. Mountains, coastlines, jungles, forests, desert dunes... it had everything.

“So where are we going?” Erika asks you.

“Serenity.” You answer. “One of the most fabulous beach resorts available on the planet.”

“Ooooohhh. What do they have there?”

You bring up the pamphlet on the holographic display. “It says there’s over fifty square kilometers of land, about twenty of which is the actual building.”

“Wow... impressive.” Your younger cousin muses.

“Climate is obviously quite humid, occasional rainfall here and there. Temperature averages out around thirty-two degrees celsius.” You look at the attractions. “In addition to the massive beach, there are a number of pools, indoor and outdoor. There’s a casino, a small indoor water park, a large multi-cultural selection of restaurants, and an exhibition center where they hold various events.”

“This place sounds awesome!” Erika yells with a goofy grin on her face.

You grin as well. This place truly did sound relaxing. Now that you were on your way, you were actually looking forward to kicking back for a while. You decided to take a quick check of what you had with you.

You brought: (aside from regular clothes)

- 10250 credits for expenses

- Sun screen

- Tanning lotion

- Antiseptic

- Two energy bars (apple flavor)

- Two Juice boxes (wild berry)

- A Personal Communication Device (or PCD)

- Eye Shadow (blue-violet)

- Nail Polish (red-violet)

- Hairbrush

- Toothbrush

- Dental Floss

- 3 beach towels

- 7 pairs of panties (Isabel)

- 5 pairs of panties (Erika)

Then it donned on you. Showing up in your duty uniform would just be ridiculous. You should probably change while you had the chance. You open up your suitcase and take a look at the clothes you brought. With what was available, there were four suitable outfits to wear:

>Summer Standard: A simple spaghetti-strap top with some shorts and simple shoes. When unable to decide on what to wear, this default outfit was always a great fallback option.

>Floral Beauty: A rather modest but ravishing skirt decorated with various flowers on an ocean blue, along with a basic white sleeveless top and straw sandals. It’s relaxing aura makes staying awake for long periods of time difficult, but the stress-free feeling reduces shyness and anxiety.

>Workout Woman: Sports bra and shorts with cleats intended for the fitness-spirit woman, but breathes excellently. You always feel ready for more action with this thing, but it isn’t the sexiest outfit in your wardrobe.

>Blue Team Bikini: A simple two-piece swimsuit sporting the colors of the team you so proudly command. Leaving little to the imagination, it makes persuading others a much easier task but you can’t help but feel a bit too exposed when wearing it.

This being her first trip to Serenity, you should probably recommend an outfit to Erika as well.

>Kitty Classic: A favorite of young girls, this t-shirt has the visage of every girl’s favorite feline cartoon character, along with a denim skirt and white shoes. It’s soft, breathable material makes it ideal for a hot tropical environment.

>Sports-girl: A well-fitting tank-top along with some comfy exercising shorts and matching running shoes. It gives Erika more energy just wearing it but there are prettier things she could wear...

>Little Blossom: A flowery skirt with a bow-covered top, meant to accentuate cuteness. Erika feels a lot less shy in such an outfit but being that cute would wear her out a bit faster than normal.

>Pink Bikini: A plain, yet sexy two-piece swimsuit that’s sure to get the boys’ attention. Between that and Erika’s cute charm, who could say “no” to her? Doubtless, though, she would feel at least slightly embarrassed showing that much skin.

[0837 hours]

You quickly strip off your uniform and get changed into your “Workout Woman” outfit, while Erika changes into her “Sports-girl” outfit. With this thing on, you were ready to begin your vacation.

“All right, I’m taking us down.” You say as you plot in a course. You then fly the shuttle down toward the Serenity landing pad.

It’s almost breathtaking. You see nary a cloud during your descent through the planet’s atmosphere, but slowly, the stars of space begin to fade as the black is replaced by a midnight blue, then a pale blue, then a light blue, until you are suddenly surrounded by beautiful blue skies. The main landform ahead, with green forests and sandy coasts that extended almost infinitely, it was a truly remarkable sight.

A silvery-white building then comes into view. You could swear it was over half a kilometer in height alone. You fly around the building until you’re above the shuttle bay.

You manage to land the ship quite gently. Pretty good for someone who doesn’t fly normally.

“Grab your stuff, little cuz. It’s vacation time!”

You and Erika grab your respective bags and open the shuttle’s hatch. You are immediately greeted by the fresh scent of the ocean and the warm tropical air. As you step out, your body becomes immersed in sunlight. It was hotter than you thought; prolonged exposure was sure to be damaging to your skin.

An attendant walks up to you and Erika. “Welcome to Serenity, ladies!” She greets you. “If you’ll follow me, I’ll take you to the hotel lobby.”

The attendant leads you down a path that was obviously used to show new arrivals the various attractions Serenity had to offer. To your left, the metal path lead into the sands of the vast beach the resort was so famous for. The horizon of the ocean seemed to go on endlessly. To your right, was a long strip of shops and restaurants of various kinds, just as it said in the brochure. As you went further down, you saw various sporting courts. There were a few areas for human sports like tennis and volleyball, some of the brelnan sports like pazeeth, and several swim-race pools.

“This place is amazing!” Erika says with awe. “I don’t know what I wanna do first!”

“Why don’t we check into our hotel room first?” You say to your overly ecstatic cousin.

____

The lobby is one of the most grand pieces of architecture you had seen before. The intricate designs carved into the walls in addition to all of the paintings, plants, and holograms that decorated the place. Truly a grand palace that announced to all that you have come here to be pampered. You walk forward to the front desk and are greeted by another young lady.

“Welcome to the Serenity hotel!” She says with a cheery tone, “How may I help you?”

“My little cousin and I were hoping to stay a few weeks.” you respond.

“Ah, not certain how long you’re going to stay, huh?” She smiles. “In that case, perhaps you’d be interested in our premium deal, made especially for uncertain visitors.”

“Go on...”

The woman presses a few buttons on her console and a flat, rectangular holo image appears in front of you. “You can stay up to a month here by placing a down payment of 10,000 credits. If you decide to leave before the month expires, you get part of your deposit back in proportion to the length of your stay.”

You knew this place wouldn’t be cheap, but on your salary, you could afford it. And this place was far too heavenly to pass up. “All right, sounds good.”

“Excellent! If you’ll sign here...” She hands you a datapad. “And then you may go ahead and check into your room.

You excitedly sign the pad, most likely just an agreement promising you won’t do anything crazy like ruin furniture or pee on the floor. Nothing worth worrying about. You place the 10,000 credits on the desk, then accept your room key.

[Currency lost: 10,000 credits]

“Okay, everything’s in order. You are room 131, down the hall to your left.”

[items gained: Room 131 key]

“Thank you.” You say.

“Have a wonderful stay! Don’t forget to check out our casino!”

You grab your bags, Erika grabs hers, and the two of you head off to your no-doubt-extravagant room.

___

“Here we are.” You say to your cousin. “Room 131.”

“Go in! Go in!” She starts pushing your rear.

The two of you walk in and are nearly swept away by the beauty of the room. It was akin to an apartment. There were two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, two closets, and a bathroom. Both bedrooms were relatively small themselves, but they were nice nevertheless. Each one a queen size bed, two side tables, a dresser and a great view of the beach.

The living room had two nice couches arranged in a typical fashion around a central entertainment terminal, where one could watch movies, play games, communicate with home or view the resort catalogue.

The kitchen was most impressive. A full stove and oven, a refrigeration and freezing unit, large sink and the fanciest dishes and silverware you had ever seen in a hotel.

The bathroom was the most grand of all. In addition to the fanciest toilet you could ever hope to sit your cheeks upon, it had a large bath that looked more like a jacuzzi, and separate from that was a steam shower, big enough for at least three people. There was also the softest linen ever here. You can’t resist the urge to rub your face on its fuzzy cloth.

“This place is so cool!” Erika exclaims. “Even houses aren’t this nice!”

“It’s pretty impressive.” You agree. “But I can’t wait to see what else this place has to offer.”

“What should we do first?”

“Let’s decide.” You walk over to the terminal and bring up the catalogue. The best activities to choose from are:

> Hit the beach

> Visit the promenade (shops, restaurants, etc.)

> Head to the Casino

> Check out the water park

> Try out some sports

> Lounge about in the hotel room

> Other: ___

Note: Current inventory and party member stats will now be displayed on first post for ease of access. I will update it in accordance with the story.

Note no. 2: Your hotel room is your sanctuary. You are free to do as you please you here. You may also come here to swap outfits, store surplus inventory, and recharge stamina by resting.

[0845 hours]

You decide, regardless of your choice of outfit, to take a visit to the water park. There was bound to be some interesting things to do there.

“Well, how about we go and check out that water park?” You say to your cousin.

“Sure!” She pauses for a minute. “Should... we change outfits then?”

Sharp cookie, that girl. “How about we just bring them with us? Then, if we decide to do something there, we can change outfits.”

Erika nods. “All right then.”

“Firstly,” you say, “let’s apply some of that sunscreen.”

[sunscreen used on: Isabel, Erika; 3/5 uses remaining]

“Not much in that little bottle, is there?” Erika comments.

“One use is good for a whole day though.” You remind her. “Though if we plan on staying longer, we will have to head to the promenade and buy some more.”

“Ah...”

“Well, let’s not waste time! Off to the Serenity water park!” You grab your pack along with yours and Erika’s swim suits, and with a burst of enthusiasm and anticipation, the two of you rush out the door.

____

You arrive back in the lobby where there is a young hostess serving some drinks.

“Hello!” She greets you in an overly-ecstatic tone. “Thank you for choosing Serenity as your vacation spot! To better improve you vacation experience, we are giving out some complimentary bottled drinks! Would you like one?

Your eyes widen. There was a pretty good selection for complimentary drinks.

“What do you want, Erika?” you ask.

“I’ll have whatever you have.”

Hmm... but what drink would you have?

- Water

- Orange Juice

- Wild Berry Juice

- Lemonade

- Comet Cola

- Nebula Soda

- Iced Tea

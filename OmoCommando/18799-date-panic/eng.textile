If you're joining the story for the first time, all voting is closed, as the story is over. However, the second installment is already underway. https://omorashi.org/topic/20809-date-panic-2/

Here's a little game I've had on my drawing board for a while. An omorashi dating sim, done in a style not unlike Melissa Explains it All, using my own original characters. Each character presents a unique personality and factor of difficulty. Remember, you aren't limited to the choices I provide. Feel free to offer a suggestion of your own, or add to an existing option. So here goes. The longer you can keep your date desperate, the more points you earn!

Your best friend just hooked you up with a hot date for tonight. After many lonely nights, you've been looking forward to this evening for weeks now. You're all dressed and ready for the big night, putting on your nicest clothes and shoes, freshening up to the best of your ability.

But before we get started, who is the girl you got hooked up with?

Emma O'Neill

Age: 20

Occupation: College Student studying medicine

Personality: Mild, easy-going

Persuasion Difficulty: Easy (final score will be reduced)

Emma is just another fellow student at the university. Well… not just another student. She's probably the prettiest girl in your bio-chemistry class. At least once, you find your eyes slowly fixating on her in the middle of class. That elegant smile, those bright eyes, and that cute bubbly laugh, who wouldn't want a date with her? Emma has always been one of the quiet ones, and very eager to please.

Isabel Lester

Age: 23

Occupation: Military Officer

Personality: Outgoing, adventurous

Persuasion Difficulty: Medium

Isabel is a local officer of the marine corps. who has taken a six-month leave to attend some college classes. A headstrong woman of great character; boldness and resolve radiate off of her when you walk by her in the halls. Her strength and beauty are quite fetching, and that sense of determination and charisma, you can't help but admire it. Isabel has a mind of her own, but is also looking for a good companion to have some exciting and romantic fun with.

Nikki Redfield

Age: Unknown

Occupation: Unknown

Personality: Flirtatious, Eccentric

Persuasion Difficulty: Hard (final score will be multiplied)

Though appearing young, Nikki has proven to have a high maturity level. Far above that of any teenager. Her self-confidence, her snide attitude, and her ability to breeze through tests tells you she is actually far older than she appears. Still, something about that child-like aspect of her appearance makes her adorably cute. You can't help but wonder how fun someone like this might be on a date. Nevertheless, she is a rather headstrong person, and you can tell she thinks quite inwardly. Best go with a full wallet.

Since choosing who's the date is so crucial to the story, this decision will be done via popular vote.

@Credil: Nikki is difficult because she tends to do as she pleases. She is very difficult to control and is more likely to yank her pants down and pee in the middle of the street before holding to the point of bursting. I leave it to the audience to decide whether you all want her to hold for as long as she can, get her to wet herself, or simply watch her pee somewhere, but the infamous little wet vampire has a tendency to not do what you want her to. Her behavior is spontaneous and unpredictable.

Back to story

That's right! Your friend said that the girl's name was Nikki! That enigmatic girl from philosophy. It seemed every time class ended, you'd exchange glances with her. The both of you would smile at each other and your heart would seem to fly out of your chest, or so it felt. You were in for a good evening of fun.

First it would be smart to take some things with you. You have at your disposal...

- A box of assorted chocolates

- A red rose

- A Twelve-sided die

- A 300 ml (12. fl oz) bottle of water

- A paper clip

- A flashlight

- Your phone

- Roughly 200 units of currency (cR)

It wasn't going to be a vacation after all, just an evening out. You weren't going to need too much. So with that done, it was time to go pick up your date. You're about to reach for your keys when you hear a knock on the door.

Who could that be? It's nearly dinner time!

You open the door, and your eyes nearly pop out.

"Hi there!"

There she was. Nikki Redfield. Small girl, but still incredibly cute. You sheepishly greet her, because you definitely weren't expecting her to walk all the way to your place. Though, spontaneous action was Nikki's MO, so you suppose it shouldn't be unexpected.

"I know, you said you'd pick me up, but I wanted to surprise you!" She grins playfully. "So where are we going?"

Hmmm… you were still deciding on that. You glance over at the brochures on your table. The best places you had in mind were the Fairy Tale amusement park, the Silver Leaf restaurant and casino, and the East City Shopping Center. All had a wide range of activities and places to eat.

Where will you take Nikki?

> Amusement Park

> Restaurant and Casino

Current Trust Level: Neutral

Trust Level: This level is a reflection of how much your date likes and trusts you. Depending on your actions and your choice of words, this level will go up or down. A high level of trust such as "Secure" or "Infatuated" means your date is comfortable around you and is more likely to tell you personal things about herself or do something requested of her. A low level such as "Distant" or "Creeped Out" will mean she will be more nervous and/or distrusting of you, not wanting to talk to you about things such as how badly she needs to go to the bathroom. Be careful! Should the level drop too low, your date may leave you!

Modsnipe: The items are for you to use at any time as you see fit, such as using the D12 to make a quick, friendly wager with someone. Though the main reason I decided to use a D12 instead of a D20 is because the D20 was too aggravating to draw @[email protected]

Back to story

"I have a nice evening planned for us at the Silver Leaf Restaurant and Casino!" You say to your date.

"Oh? Sounds expensive." Nikki replies. "I approve."

The two of you walk out to your car, and like the good person you are, you open the door for Nikki and let her into the passenger side. She looks up at you and wiggles her eyebrows once with an amused look on her face. You then climb into your side, insert your keys and start up the car, heading off to get started on your big night.

As you drive down to your intended destination, you glance over at your red-haired date.

She has a calm, peaceful expression on her face, but something about it looked as if she was possibly planning something. Must be Nikki's way of expressing anticipation. She must be looking forward to this as much as you are! You then look up at the clock.

"5:15"

The sun was already down, and you had the whole night ahead of you, but it would be a while before you reached the restaurant. Time to break the awkward silence.

What would be the best thing to talk about?

> "So tell me a little about yourself."

> "How about that weather?"

> "What are your career plans?"

> Other [Create your own dialogue option]

Current Trust Level: Neutral

Addendum: This is intended to be a low-key story, so Nikki's vampirism will not be playing a very high role in it. Though we, the audience, are aware of it, the main character is not and Nikki would prefer to keep it a secret anyway for the sake of furthering her education.

EDIT: Why can't we date Nowi? I would like to date her if at all possible.

}}

Nowi is not an original character of mine, as much as I'd love to include her, so I won't be using her. It is, however, entirely possible that our secret character is based off of her.

EDIT #2: Would you ever consider re-activating the Serenity game?(The summer vacation one) It's almost summer again, at least in the US where I am.

I have been considering it, actually. I'm still not sure if I'm going to go for it, but I may if only for a break from "Date Panic!". Time will tell.

Story indefinitely suspended.

So we've finished a stimulating round with the willful and headstrong Nikki Redfield which ended up in a very desperate situation. With the successful completion of that date, it is time to start a new game, with new experiences! The mechanics will be slightly different this time around; you gain points for a variety of things, which mainly include:

- How long you kept your date desperate

- How high the trust between you gets

- Whether or not your date would go out with you again

- Certain hidden achievements

Some of you have already voted on who you would like to go on a date with next (and your votes are logged), but I will give a chance to those that have not yet gotten the chance. Again, here are your choices:

Emma O'Neill

Age: 20

Occupation: College Student studying medicine

Personality: Mild, easy-going

Persuasion Difficulty: Easy (final score will be reduced)

Emma is just another fellow student at the university. Well… not just another student. She's probably the prettiest girl in your bio-chemistry class. At least once, you find your eyes slowly fixating on her in the middle of class. That elegant smile, those bright eyes, and that cute bubbly laugh, who wouldn't want a date with her? Emma has always been one of the quiet ones, and very eager to please.

Isabel Lester

Age: 23

Occupation: Military Officer

Personality: Outgoing, adventurous

Persuasion Difficulty: Medium

Isabel is a local officer of the marine corps. who has taken a six-month leave to attend some college classes. A headstrong woman of great character; boldness and resolve radiate off of her when you walk by her in the halls. Her strength and beauty are quite fetching, and that sense of determination and charisma, you can't help but admire it. Isabel has a mind of her own, but is also looking for a good companion to have some exciting and romantic fun with.

Nikki Redfield

Age: Unknown

Occupation: Unknown

Personality: Flirtatious, Eccentric

Persuasion Difficulty: Hard (final score will be multiplied)

Though appearing young, Nikki has proven to have a high maturity level. Far above that of any teenager. Her self-confidence, her snide attitude, and her ability to breeze through tests tells you she is actually far older than she appears. Still, something about that child-like aspect of her appearance makes her adorably cute. You can't help but wonder how fun someone like this might be on a date. Nevertheless, she is a rather headstrong person, and you can tell she thinks quite inwardly. Best go with a full wallet.

Voting closed. Emma O'Neill is selected.

Emma O'Neill

Yeah! After many hours of practicing in front of the mirror, you had finally worked up the courage to ask out Emma O'Neill; the shy, but cute girl from bio-chem. Her shift at the clinic ended at 5 PM and you had agreed to pick her up there. As you had from your last date, you brought along a series of seemingly random items.

- A box of assorted chocolates (may boost trust level, if accepted)

- A red rose (may boost trust level, if accepted)

- A twelve-sided die (used for spontaneous gambling)

- A 300 ml. (12 fl oz.) bottle of water (for quenching thirst and dousing fire)

- A paper clip (the world's most versatile tool)

- A flashlight (fresh new batteries!)

- Your phone (the world's other most versatile tool)

- 200 units of currency (cR)

You get into your car and drive off towards the hospital.

###

You get there within moments, and it seems your date is as eager to begin as you are. The lovely Emma, standing gracefully at the sidewalk, waiting for you.

She opens the door and climbs in.

"Hello!"

"Hi Emma! Are you all ready for tonight?"

"Mhm!" she responds. "Where are we going to go?"

Hmmm... yes, the big question of every date. Where to go?

The most popular local attractions were always a safe bet.

- Restaurant and Casino

- Amusement Park

- Shopping Center

But then, the words of a certain girl echo in your mind. Oh yes! Now you remember what Nikki gave you just before you parted ways.

"It's called a portal card. As long as you have someone special with along with you, it will transport you to any place you want to go for your date and bring you back whenever you want! No limits whatsoever!"

You had no idea how this worked or how it was brought into existence, but you couldn't pass an opportunity like this up. The card glows and pulsates with luminescent light, with the blue spectral gateway in the center showing translucent images of various locations. A magic forest filled with spirits, and massive space station bustling with people of different species, a demonic castle high atop black mountain peaks, and... the game arcade in the next city over? Okay then...

So you could quite truly go anywhere you wanted... where would you go?

- Restaurant and Casino

- Amusement Park

- Shopping Center

- Magic Forest

- Space Station

- Demon Castle

- Game Arcade

- Other*

* = We'll probably need some level of consensus for this. If people agree upon an idea, we'll go for it, otherwise, I'll probably pick a suggestion at random.

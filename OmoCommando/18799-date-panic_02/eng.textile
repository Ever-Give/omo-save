We need to get her to trust us; "tell me a little about yourself".

"So, we haven't really spoken much outside of class. Could you tell me a little bit about yourself?" You ask.

"Ooooooh, so forward." Nikki responds in a flirtatious manner. "I like it." There's a brief silence. You aren't sure whether you offended her with your directness or not. The girl then laughs out loud. "Seriously though, I'm a prettyâ€¦ solitary person. I like to keep to myself but there's some nights when I really like to go out and party. Know what I mean?"

You nod politely.

Nikki puts a hand on her chest.

"I was born up north, raised in a family of seven children, all girls."

"My, must've made sleeping arrangements difficult."

Your date nods her head. "On a more personal note, I like vodka martinis, lobster dinners, diamond jewelry and dates with deep pockets."

Once again, you aren't sure whether or not the girl is being serious.

Nikki then looks over at you.

"How about yourself? Who are you and what do you do?"

What should you tell Nikki about yourself?

> [something bold and daring]

> [something moderate, but believable]

> [something mild and modest]

> Other

Well since there's such a heavy lean towards the moderate option, we'll go that route.

You decide that the best way to impress her is by telling her something about yourself that she's likely to believe.

"Well, I'm a pretty regular person myself. I work at the clinic on the north side of town, and my favorite things are smoked salmon, mimosas, andâ€¦" you paused for a moment. "Red-haired girls."

Nikki stares at you for moment, as if processing what you just told her. A few seconds of silence pass by, and she breaks out in a modest laugh.

"Ahahahaha! That's cute!"

Nikki has an appreciation for humor apparently.

You finally arrive at the Silver Leaf. A rather large place with an elaborate fountain in the front. It almost reminded you of some fancy resort. You step out of your car, and walk around to let your date out. As you open the door, she offers you her hand, which you accept and lead her out of the vehicle. Gracefully, she steps out, then looks over to you and winks.

"Are you ready?" You ask.

"I sure am!" She replies.

The two of you walk up to the double doors of the restaurant where a security guard asks for your ID's. You can't help but wonder about Nikki, since she appears a bit on the young side. However, she hands her ID to the guard and he accepts without question.

The bright lights, the aroma of freshly grilled meats, the sound of slot machines paying out coins, the Silver Leaf was quite the hub of activity. The casino had quite a lot of games to choose from, but at the same time, the smell of all that food was getting to you. You look over to your date, whose expression is rather difficult to read. You can't tell what she wants to do.

"So, what would you like to do first?" You ask.

"Eh, either one sounds good. I'm hungry enough to eat but I'd play some games for a while."

Which activity should you do first?

> Have dinner

> Hit the casino (if no game is specified, I'll select at random)

> Buy Nikki a drink

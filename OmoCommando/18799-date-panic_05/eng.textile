"Hey, let's give the crap tables a shot!" You say.

"The what?" Nikki gives you a confused look.

"Craps." You reply. "It's a table game involving dice rolls."

"Ohâ€¦ right."

The two of you walk over to the nearest table and you lay down a few chips on various areas.

Unfortunately, neither yours nor Nikki's luck appears to be holding out. Despite the pass line bets you make, the dice are not favoring you. Those sevens come up at all the wrong times, and before you know it, you're down seventy chips.

But, on a mere chance, you drop a few chips on the hardways. Hoping for that double three, you shoot the dice and...

Not bad. You recovered most of your losses, but you're still down to about a total of 280 cR. A new round begins, and the come-out roll is to be made. However, you look over at your date.

She has a rather unamused expression on her face. You're not sure if she's just annoyed with losing or if she finds the game boring. Either way, she's been kind enough not to say anything.

What should you do?

> Continue as is.

> Offer to let Nikki roll the dice

> Ask her "What's wrong?"

> Switch to a different game (specify game)

> Head to dinner

> Other

Current trust level: Comfortable

Side note: Nikki's betting so far has been made using her own money, in case that isn't clear. What is meant to be unclear is how much money she has left.

"Absolutely! I challenge you to a holding contest!" you say.

Nikki stares at you blankly. You just pause and hold still like a statue. The awkwardness of the moment is… overwhelming.

"Are you high?" Nikki asks. "I'm not going to do a holding contest with you. That's just… weird."

"Oh…" Your enthusiasm crumbles to dust. Nikki seemed like the kind of girl who might be into that sort of thing. Her decision is rather… unexpected.

"Now stop interrupting me! I'll be right back!" Nikki says with an irritated tone. She walks off towards the bathrooms before you can give any sort of retort.

You hang your head. Though the date itself seemed to go smoothly, you weren't able to have any omorashi fun. Well there's always the next date.

GAME OVE-

...

"The bathrooms are closed."

You perk up. Nikki is back, and she has a rather irritated look on her face.

"A pipe burst or something and they're trying to repair it."

Well that was certainly a lucky- er… that's unfortunate.

Console your date!

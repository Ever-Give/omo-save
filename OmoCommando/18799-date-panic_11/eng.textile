I like the ice cream idea, and if she still tries to head off to the restroom ask her in a joking kind of way, "what, can't hold it any longer," and maybe kind of give a wink. May be a little daring but I think she would totally go with it.

"Well how about we just get some ice cream instead?" you say.

"Instead of going to the bathroom?" Nikki raises an eyebrow. "I just need to pee! What's wrong with you?" The girl frowns and shakes her head. "I'll be right back. Rest, get some ice cream, do whatever you like." Nikki turns and heads towards the direction of the bathrooms.

"What? You can't hold it any longer?" You call out.

Nikki stops. She slowly turns around and gives you a dubious look.

"Hmmmâ€¦ Is that a challenge?"

Your response?

> Yes! I challenge you to a holding contest!

> N-No! Just joking around!

> Other

Current trust level: Very friendly

Nikki's Desperation Level: Unable to hold still

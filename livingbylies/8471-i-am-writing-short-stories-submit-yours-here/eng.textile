To anyone who bothers to read the crap I post!

I am trying to write lots of short stories as of recently, but I am in an idea rut. So, submit your own! I won't write all of them, but I will write the ones I like.

Just so you know, things I like:

Desperation (Duh.)

Diapers

Trickery, deceit, etc.

Messing

Drugs (That is, Laxatives, Diuretics, etc.)

Infantialism

Light romance

Bondage

Sci-Fi

Things I don't like:

Hardcore romance (IE, fuck scenes)

Unrealistic situations

Anything that will take more than four chapters to write

M/M romance (Sorry, nothing against it, I just don't like it myself)

Fanfiction

Sorry... Read the last bit in the list of 'don't like so much.' (Also, I prefer a bit more details. But, feel free to submit another with more details, OC, and I will gladly write it.)

Go ahead and PM. I have two in the works, (one of which I hope to finish tonight) but seeing as they are short, go ahead, they won't take long.
